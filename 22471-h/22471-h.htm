<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a><i>Preface</i></h2>


<p>In an Age when man's horizons are constantly being widened
to include hitherto little-known or non-existent countries, and
even other planets and outer space, there is still much to be said
for the oft-neglected study of man in his more immediate environs.
Intrigued with the historical tale of the "Fair Play settlers" of the
West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna River and practically a life-long
resident of the West Branch Valley, this writer felt that their
story was worth telling and that it might offer some insight into
the development of democracy on the frontier. The result is an
ethnography of the Fair Play settlers. This account, however, is not
meant to typify the frontier experience; it is simply an illustration,
and, the author hopes, a useful one.</p>

<p>No intensive research can be conducted without the help and encouragement
of many fine and wonderful people. This author is
deeply indebted to librarians, archivists and historians, local historians
and genealogists, local and county historical societies, and
collectors of manuscripts, diaries, and journals pertinent to the history
of the West Branch Valley. A comprehensive listing of all who
have assisted in this effort would be too extensive, but certain persons
cannot be ignored. My grateful appreciation is here expressed to a
few of these; but my gratitude is no less sincere to the many persons
who are not here mentioned.</p>

<p>Librarians who have been most helpful in providing bibliographies,
checking files, and obtaining volumes from other libraries include
Miss Isabel Welch, of the Ross Library in Lock Haven; Mrs.
Kathleen Chandler, formerly of the Lock Haven State College library;
and Miss Barbara Ault, of the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>Archivists and historians who have been most generous in their
aid are the late Dr. Paul A. W. Wallace, of the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission; Mrs. Phyllis V. Parsons, of Collegeville;
Dr. Alfred P. James, of the University of Pittsburgh; and
Mrs. Solon J. Buck, of Washington, D. C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant research support for this investigation
was provided by a local historian and genealogist, Mrs. Helen Herritt
Russell, of Jersey Shore.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel P. Bayard, of the Pennsylvania State University,
analyzed the Fair Play settlers using linguistic techniques to determine
their national origins. This help was basic to the demographic
portion of this study.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles F. Berkheimer and Mrs. Marshall Anspach, both of
Williamsport, magnanimously consented to loan this author their
copies, respectively, of William Colbert's <i>Journal</i> and the Wagner
Collection of Revolutionary War Pension Claims.</p>

<p>County and local historical societies which opened their collections
for study were the Clinton County Historical Society, the Lycoming
Historical Society, the Northumberland County Historical Society,
the Centre County Historical Society, the Greene County Historical
Society, and the Muncy Historical Society and Museum of History.</p>

<p>For his refreshing criticisms and constant encouragement, Dr. Murray
G. Murphey, of the University of Pennsylvania, will find me forever
thankful. Without him, this study would not have been possible.</p>

<p>The author would like to thank the members of the Pennsylvania
Historical and Museum Commission and its Executive Director, Dr.
S. K. Stevens, for making possible this publication; he would also like
to thank Mr. Donald H. Kent, Director of the Bureau of Archives and
History, and Mr. William A. Hunter, Chief of the Division of History,
who supervised publication; and members of the staff of the Division
of History: Mr. Harold L. Myers, Associate Historian and Chief of
the Editorial Section, who readied the manuscript for publication;
Mrs. Gail M. Gibson, Associate Historian, who prepared the index;
and Mr. George R. Beyer, Assistant Historian.</p>

<p>My sincerest thanks are also extended to Mrs. Mary B. Bower, who
typed the entire manuscript and offered useful suggestions with regard
to style.</p>

<p>Finally, for providing almost ideal conditions for carrying on this
work and for sustaining me throughout, my wife, Margaret, is deserving
of a gratitude which cannot be fully expressed.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a><i>Introduction</i></h2>


<p>Between 1769 and 1784, in an area some twenty-five miles long
and about two miles wide, located on the north side of the
West Branch of the Susquehanna River and extending from
Lycoming Creek (at the present Williamsport) to the Great Island
(just east of the present Lock Haven), some 100 to 150 families settled.
They established a community and a political organization
called the Fair Play system. This study is about these people and
their system.</p>

<p>The author of a recent case study of democracy in a frontier
county commented on the need for this kind of investigation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Cognizant
of the fact that a number of valuable histories of American
communities have been written, he noted that few of them deal explicitly
with the actual relation of frontier experience to democracy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No one seems to have studied microscopically a given area
that experienced transition from wilderness to settled community
with the purpose of determining how much democracy,
in Turner's sense, existed initially in the first phase of
settlement, during the process itself, and in the period that
immediately followed.</p></div>

<p>This research encompasses the first two stages of that development
and includes tangential references to the third stage.</p>

<p>The geography of the Fair Play territory has been confused for almost
two centuries. The conclusions of this analysis will not prove
too satisfying to those who unquestioningly accept and revere the old
local legends. However, it will be noted that these conclusions are
based upon the accounts of journalists and diarists rather than hearsay.
This should put the controversial "question of the Tiadaghton"
to rest.</p>

<p>A statistical analysis has been made as a significant part of the
demography of the Fair Play settlers. However, limitations in data
may raise some questions regarding the validity of the conclusions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Nevertheless, the national and ethnic origins of these settlers, their
American sources of emigration, the periods of immigration, the
reasons for migration, and population stability and mobility have
all been investigated. The result offers some surprises when compared
with the trends of the time&mdash;in the Province and throughout
the colonies.</p>

<p>The <i>politics</i> of Fair Play is the principal concern of this entire
study&mdash;appropriately, it was from their political system that these
frontiersmen derived their unusual name. This was not the only
group to use the name, however. Another "fair play system" existed
in southwestern Pennsylvania during the same period, and perhaps
a similar study can be made of those pioneers and their life.
As for the Fair Play community of the West Branch, we know about
its political structure through the cases subsequently reviewed by established
courts of the Commonwealth. From these cases, we have
reconstructed a "code" of operation which demonstrates certain
democratic tendencies.</p>

<p>In addition to studying the political system, an effort has been
made to validate the story of the locally-famed Pine Creek Declaration
of Independence. Although some evidence for such a declaration
was found, it seems inconclusive.</p>

<p>The West Branch Valley was part of what Turner called the second
frontier, the Allegheny, and so this agrarian frontier community has
been examined for evidence of the democratic traits which Turner
characterized as particularly American. This analysis is not meant
to portray a typical situation, but it does provide support for Turner's
evaluation. As this was a farmer's frontier, and as transportation
and communication facilities were extremely limited, a generally
self-sufficient and naturally self-reliant community developed as a
matter of survival. The characteristics which this frontier nurtured,
and the non-English&mdash;even anti-English&mdash;composition of its population
make understandable the sentiment in this region for independence
from Great Britain. This, of course, is supremely demonstrated
in the separate declaration of independence drawn, according to the
report, by the settlers of the Fair Play frontier.</p>

<p>Fair Play <i>society</i> is, perhaps, the second-most-important facet of
this ethnographic analysis. An understanding of it necessitated an
inquiry into the social relationships, the religious institutions, the
educational and cultural opportunities, and the values of this frontier
community. The results, again, lend credence to Turner's hypothesis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Admittedly, Turner's bold assertion that "the growth of
nationalism and the evolution of American political institutions were
dependent on the advance of the frontier" is somewhat contradicted
by the nature of this Pennsylvania frontier. Western lands in Pennsylvania
were either Provincial, Commonwealth, or Indian lands, but
never national lands. As a result, western land ordinances, and the
whole controversy which accompanied the ratification of the Articles
of Confederation, had no real significance in Pennsylvania. However,
in subsequent years, the expansion of internal improvement
legislation and nationalism sustains Turner's thesis, as does the democratic
and non-sectional nature of the middle colonial region generally.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The <i>intellectual character</i> which the frontier spawned has been
described as rationalistic. However, this was a rationalism which was
not at odds with empiricism, but which was more in line with what
has been called the American philosophy, pragmatism. Or, to put it
in the vernacular, "if it works, it's good." The frontiersman was a
trial-and-error empiricist, who believed in his own ability to fathom
the depths of the problems which plagued him. If the apparent
solution contradicted past patterns and interpretations, he justified
his actions in terms of the realities of the moment. It is this
pragmatic ratio-empiricism which we imply when we use the term
"rationalistic."</p>

<p>An examination of the role of <i>leadership</i>, suggested by the Curti
study, presents the first summary of this type for the West Branch
Valley. Here, too, the limited numbers of this frontier population,
combined with its peculiar tendency to rely upon peripheral residents
for top leadership, prevents any broad generalizations. The nature
of its leadership can only be interpreted in terms of this particular
group in this specific location.</p>

<p>The last two chapters of this study are summary chapters. The
first of these is an analysis of democracy on one segment of the
Pennsylvania frontier. Arbitrarily defining democracy, certain objective
criteria were set up to evaluate it in the Fair Play territory.
Political democracy was investigated in terms of popular sovereignty,
political equality, popular consultation, and majority rule, and the
political system was judged on the basis of these principles. Social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
democracy was ascertained through inquiries concerning religious
freedom, the social class system, and economic opportunity. The
conclusion is that, for this frontier at least, democratic tendencies
were displayed in various contexts.</p>

<p>The final chapter, although relying to a large extent upon Turner's
great work, is in no way intended to be a critical evaluation of that
thesis. Its primary objective is to test one interpretation of it through
a particular analytic technique, ethnographic in nature. Frontier
ethnography has proved to be a reliable research tool, mainly because
of its wide scope. It permits conclusions which a strictly confined
study, given the data limitations of this and other frontier areas,
would not allow.</p>

<p>Democracy, it is no doubt agreed, is a difficult thing to assess, particularly
when there are so many conflicting interpretations of it.
But an examination of it, even in its most primitive stages in this
country, can give the researcher a glimpse of its fundamentals and
its effectiveness. In a time when idealists envision a world community
based upon the self-determination which was basic in this
nation's early development, it is essential to re-evaluate that principle
in terms of its earliest American development. If we would enjoy
the blessings of freedom, we must undergo the fatigue of
attempting to understand it.</p>

<p>Some seventy years ago, a great American historian suggested an
interpretation of the American ethos. Turner's thesis is still being
debated today, something which I am certain would please its author
immensely. But what is needed today is not the prolongation of the
debate as to its validity so much as the investigation of it with newer
techniques which, it might be added, Turner himself suggested.
This is the merit of frontier ethnography, and, perhaps, the particular
value of this study.</p>

<p>To me, Robert Frost implied as much in his wonderful "Stopping
by Woods on a Snowy Evening." Yes, the "woods" of contemporary
history are "lovely, dark and deep,</p>

<span class="i0">And miles to go before I sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And miles to go before I sleep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is hoped that this investigation is the beginning of the answer
to that promise, but it is well-recognized that there are miles to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="ity"><big>Fair Play Territory: Geography and Topography</big></h3>


<p>The Colonial period of American history has been of primary
concern to the historian because of its fundamental importance
in the development of American civilization. What
the American pioneers encountered, particularly in the interior settlements,
was, basically, a frontier experience. An ethnographic analysis
of one part of the Provincial frontier of Pennsylvania indicates
the significance of that colonial influence. The "primitive agricultural
democracy" of this frontier illustrates the "style of life" which provided
the basis for a distinctly "American" culture which emerged
from the colonial experience.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>While this writer's approach is dominantly Turnerian, this study
does not necessarily contend that this Pennsylvania frontier was typical
of the general colonial experience, nor that this ethnographic
analysis presents in microcosm the development of the American
ethos. However, on this farmer's frontier there was adequate evidence
of the composite nationality, the self-reliance, the independence,
and the nationalistic and rationalistic traits which Turner characterized
as American.</p>

<p>In his famed essay on "The Significance of the Frontier," Turner
saw the frontier as the crucible in which the English, Scotch-Irish, and
Palatine Germans were merged into a new and distinctly American
nationality, no longer characteristically English.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The Pennsylvania
frontier, with its dominant Scotch-Irish and German influence, is a
case in point.</p>

<p>The Fair Play territory of the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna
River, the setting for this analysis, was part of what Turner
called the second frontier, the Allegheny Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Located about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
ninety miles up the Susquehanna from the present State capital at
Harrisburg, and extending some twenty-five-odd miles westward between
the present cities of Williamsport and Lock Haven, this
territory was the heartland of the central Pennsylvania frontier in
the decade preceding the American Revolution.</p>

<p>The term "Fair Play settlers," used to designate the inhabitants
of this region, is derived from the extra-legal political system which
these democratic forerunners set up to maintain order in their
developing community. Being squatters and, consequently, without
the bounds of any established political agency, they formed their
own government, and labeled it "Fair Play."</p>

<p>However, despite the apparent simplicity of the above geographic
description, the exact boundaries of the Fair Play territory have
been debated for almost two centuries. Before we can assess the democratic
traits of the Fair Play settlers, we must first clearly define what
is meant by the Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>The terminal points in this analysis are 1768 and 1784, the dates
of the two Indian treaties made at Fort Stanwix (now Rome), New
York. The former opened up the Fair Play territory to settlement,
and the latter brought it within the limits of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, thus legalizing the <i>de facto</i> political structure which
had developed in the interim.</p>

<p>According to the treaty of 1768, negotiated by Sir William Johnson
with the Indians of the Six Nations, the western line of colonial
settlement was extended from the Allegheny Mountains, previously
set by the Proclamation of 1763, to a line extending to the mouth of
Lycoming Creek, which empties into the West Branch of the Susquehanna
River. The creek is referred to as the Tiadaghton in the
original of the treaty.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The question of whether Pine Creek or
Lycoming Creek was the Tiadaghton is the first major question of
this investigation. The map which faces page one outlines the
territory in question.</p>

<p>Following the successful eviction of the French in the French and
Indian War, the American counterpart of the Seven Years' War, the
crown sought a more orderly westward advance than had been the
rule. Heretofore, the establishment of frontier settlements had stirred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
up conflict with the Indians and brought frontier pleas to the colonial
assemblies for military support and protection. The result was
greater pressure on the already depleted exchequer. The opinion
that a more controlled and less expensive westward advance could
be accomplished is reflected in the Royal Proclamation of 1763.</p>

<p>This proclamation has frequently been misinterpreted as a definite
effort to deprive the colonies of their western lands. The very language
of the document contradicts this. For example, the expression
"for the present, and until our further pleasure be known" clearly
indicates the tentative nature of the proclamation, which was "to
prevent [the repetition of] such irregularities for the future" with
the Indians, irregularities which had prompted Pontiac's Rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The orderly advancement of this colonial frontier was to be accomplished
through subsequent treaties with the Indians. The Treaty
of Fort Stanwix in 1768 is one such example of those treaties.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The term "Fair Play settlers" refers to the residents of the area
between Lycoming Creek and the Great Island on the north side of
the West Branch of the Susquehanna River, and to those who interacted
with them, during the period 1769-1784, when that area was
outside of the Provincial limits. The appellation stems from the
annual designation by the settlers of "Fair Play Men," a tribunal of
three with quasi-executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the
residents.</p>

<p>The relevance of the first Stanwix Treaty to the geographic area
of this study is a matter of the utmost importance. The western
boundary of that treaty in the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna
has been a source of some confusion because of the employment
of the name "Tiadaghton" in the treaty to designate that boundary.
The question, quite simply, is whether Pine Creek or Lycoming is the
Tiadaghton. If Pine Creek is the Tiadaghton, an extra-legal political
organization would have been unnecessary, for the so-called Fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Play settlers of this book would have been under Provincial jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The designation of Lycoming Creek as the Tiadaghton tends
to give geographic corroboration for the Fair Play system.</p>

<p>First and foremost among the Pine Creek supporters is John
Meginness, the nineteenth-century historian of the West Branch
Valley. His work is undoubtedly the most often quoted source of
information on the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna, and
rightfully so. Although he wrote when standards of documentation
were lax and relied to an extent upon local legendry as related by
aged residents, Meginness' views have a general validity. However,
there is some question regarding his judgment concerning the
boundary issue.</p>

<p>Quoting directly from the journal of Moravian Bishop Augustus
Spangenburg, who visited the West Branch Valley in 1745 in the
company of Conrad Weiser, David Zeisberger, and John Schebosh,
Meginness describes the Bishop's travel from Montoursville, or
Ostonwaken as the Indians called it, to the "Limping Messenger,"
or "Diadachton Creek," where the party camped for the night.<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
is interesting to note that the Moravian journalist refers here to
Lycoming Creek as the Tiadaghton, some twenty-three years prior
to the purchase at Fort Stanwix, which made the question a local
issue. Yet Meginness, in a footnote written better than a hundred
years later, says that "It afterwards turned out that the true <i>Diadachton</i>
or <i>Tiadachton</i>, was what is now known as Pine Creek."<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps Meginness was influenced by the aged sources of some of
his accounts. It may be, however, that he was merely repeating the
judgment of an earlier generation which had sought to legalize its
settlement made prior to the second Stanwix Treaty. The Indian
description of the boundary line in the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768
may also have had some impact upon Meginness. Regardless, a comparison
of data, pro and con, will demonstrate that the Tiadaghton
is Lycoming Creek.</p>

<p>John Blair Linn, of Bellefonte, stood second to Meginness in
popular repute as historian of the West Branch Valley. However, he
too calls Pine Creek the Tiadaghton, though the reliability of his
sources is questionable. Unlike Meginness, whose judgment derived
somewhat from interviews with contemporaries of the period, Linn
based his contention upon the statements made by the Indians at the
second Stanwix Treaty meeting in 1784.<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>At those sessions on October 22 and 23, 1784, the Pennsylvania
commissioners twice questioned the deputies of the Six Nations about
the location of the Tiadaghton, and were told twice that it was Pine
Creek.<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In the first instance, Samuel J. Atlee, speaking for the other
Pennsylvania commissioners, called attention to the last deed made
at Fort Stanwix in 1768 and asked the question about the Tiadaghton:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This last deed, brothers, with the map annexed, are
descriptive of the purchase made sixteen years ago at this
place; one of the boundary lines calls for a creek by the name
of <i>Tyadoghton</i>, we wish our brothers the Six Nations to
explain to us clearly which you call the <i>Tyadoghton</i>, as
there are two creeks issuing from the <i>Burnet's Hills</i>, <i>Pine</i>
and <i>Lycoming</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>Captain Aaron Hill, a Mohawk chief, responded for the Indians:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With regard to the creek called <i>Tyadoghton</i>, mentioned
in your deed of 1768, we have already answered you, and
again repeat it, it is the same you call <i>Pine Creek</i>, being the
largest emptying into the west branch of the <i>Susquehannah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>This, of course, was the "more positive answer" which the Indians
had promised after the previous day's interrogation.<a name="FNanchor_14_16" id="FNanchor_14_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_16" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It substantiated
the description given in the discussions preceding the Fort Stanwix
Treaty of 1768.<a name="FNanchor_15_17" id="FNanchor_15_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_17" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> However, the map illustrating the treaty line,
although tending to support this view, is subject to interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_16_18" id="FNanchor_16_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_18" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Regardless, this record of the treaty sessions provides the strongest
evidence to sustain the Pine Creek view.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Meginness and Linn were influenced by
the record. This is certainly true of D. S. Maynard, a lesser nineteenth-century
historian, whose work is obviously based upon the research
of Meginness. Maynard repeated the evidence of his predecessor from
the account of Thomas Sergeant by describing the Stanwix Treaty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
line of 1768 as coming "across to the headwaters of Pine Creek."
Maynard's utter dependence upon Meginness suggests that his evidence
is more repetitive than substantive.<a name="FNanchor_17_19" id="FNanchor_17_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_19" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A more recent student of local history, Eugene P. Bertin, of Muncy,
gives Pine Creek his undocumented support, which appears to be
nothing more than an elaboration of the accounts of Meginness and
Linn.<a name="FNanchor_18_20" id="FNanchor_18_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_20" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Dr. Bertin's account appears to be better folklore than
history.<a name="FNanchor_19_21" id="FNanchor_19_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p>Another twentieth-century writer, Elsie Singmaster, offers more
objective support for Pine Creek, although her argument appears to
be better semantics than geography.<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Edmund A. DeSchweinitz, in his biography of David Zeisberger,
errs in his interpretation of the term "Limping Messenger" (Tiadaghton),
used by Bishop Spangenburg in his account of their journey to
the West Branch Valley in 1745. He notes that on their way to
Onondaga (Syracuse) after leaving "Ostonwaken" (Montoursville)
they passed through the valley of Tiadaghton Creek. They were following
the Sheshequin Path. But he identifies the Tiadaghton with
Pine Creek. There was an Indian path up Pine Creek, but it led to
Niagara, not Onondaga.<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Aside from the designation by the Indians at the second Stanwix
Treaty, there is only one other source which lends any credibility
to the Pine Creek view, and that is Smith's <i>Laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania</i>. After the last treaty was made acquiring Pennsylvania
lands from the Indians, the legislature, in order to quell disputes
about the right of occupancy in this "New Purchase,"<a name="FNanchor_22_24" id="FNanchor_22_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_24" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> passed
the following legislation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And whereas divers persons, who have heretofore occupied
and cultivated small tracts of land, without the bounds of
the purchase made, as aforesaid, in the year of our Lord one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight, and within the purchase
made, or now to be made, by the said commissioners,
have, by their resolute stand and sufferings during the late
war, merited, that those settlers should have the pre-emption
of their respective plantations:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid</i>, That all
and every person or persons, and their legal representatives,
who has or have heretofore settled on the north side of the
west branch of the river Susquehanna, upon the Indian territory,
between Lycomick or Lycoming creek on the east, and
Tyagaghton or Pine creek on the west, as well as other lands
within the said residuary purchase from the Indians, of the
territory within this state, excepting always the lands herein
before excepted, shall be allowed a right of pre-emption to
their respective possessions, at the price aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>It may be worth observing, however, that legislation tends to reflect
popular demand rather than the hard facts of a situation. In this
case the settlers of the region prior to 1780 stood to benefit by this
legislation and formed an effective pressure group.</p>

<p>The contrary view in this long-standing geographical debate is
based, for the most part, upon the records of journalists and diarists
who traveled along the West Branch <i>prior</i> to the first Stanwix Treaty
and who thus had no axe to grind.</p>

<p>That the Lycoming Creek was in fact the Tiadaghton referred to
by the Indians at Fort Stanwix in 1768 is strongly indicated by the
weight of evidence derived from the journals of Conrad Weiser (1737),
John Bartram (1743), Bishop Spangenburg (1745), Moravian Bishop
John Ettwein (1772), and the Reverend Philip Vickers Fithian (1775).
In addition, the maps of Lewis Evans (1749) and John Adlum (1792),
the land applications of Robert Galbreath and Martin Stover (1769),
and a 1784 statute of the Pennsylvania General Assembly all tend
to validate Lycoming's claim to recognition as the Tiadaghton. Each
datum has merit in the final analysis, which justifies the specific
examination which follows:</p>

<p>Supporting evidence is found in Weiser's German journal, which
was meant for his family and friends, and translated into English by
his great-grandson, Hiester H. Muhlenberg. (Weiser also kept an
English journal for the Council at Philadelphia.) Weiser wrote:
"The stream we are now on the Indians call Dia-daclitu, (die berirte,
the lost or bewildered) which in fact deserves such a name."<a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (This
is an obvious misspelling of Diadachton.) Weiser was following the
Sheshequin Path with Shickellamy to Onondaga and this entry is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
recorded on March 25, 1737, long before there was any question
about the Tiadaghton.</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion over Bishop Spangenburg's use
of the term "Limping Messenger" in his journal for June 8, 1745.
He too was traveling the Sheshequin Path with David Zeisberger,
Conrad Weiser, Shickellamy, Andrew Montour, <i>et al.</i> He describes
the "Limping Messenger" as a camp on the "Tiadachton" (Lycoming),
whereas DeSchweinitz in his <i>Zeisberger</i> interprets the term to mean
Pine Creek.<a name="FNanchor_25_27" id="FNanchor_25_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_27" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Another traveler along the Sheshequin Path was the colonial botanist,
John Bartram. Bartram, in the company of Weiser and Lewis
Evans, the map maker, notes in his diary of July 12, 1743, riding
"down [up] a valley to a point, a prospect of an opening bearing N,
then down the hill to a run and over a rich neck lying between it and
the Tiadaughton."<a name="FNanchor_26_28" id="FNanchor_26_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_28" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Incidentally, the editor of this extract from
Bartram's journal makes the quite devastating point that Meginness
did not know of Bartram's journal, which was published in London
in 1751 but which did not appear in America until 1895.<a name="FNanchor_27_29" id="FNanchor_27_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_29" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>One of the Moravian journalists who visited the scenic Susquehanna
along the West Branch was Bishop John Ettwein, who passed
through this valley on his way to Ohio in 1772. He wrote of "Lycoming
Creek, [as the stream] which marks the boundary line of lands
purchased from the Indians."<a name="FNanchor_28_30" id="FNanchor_28_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_30" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting and informative diarist who journeyed
along the West Branch was the Reverend Philip Vickers Fithian.
Fithian came to what we will establish as Fair Play country on July
25, 1775, at what he called "Lacommon Creek." His conclusion was
that this creek was the Tiadaghton.<a name="FNanchor_29_31" id="FNanchor_29_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_31" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is this same Fithian, it might
be added, whose Virginia journals were the primary basis for the
reconstruction of colonial Williamsburg.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>The work of colonial cartographers also substantiates the claim
that Lycoming Creek is the Tiadaghton. Both Lewis Evans, following
his 1743 journey in the company of Bartram and Weiser,
and John Adlum, who conducted a survey of the West Branch Valley
in 1792 for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, failed to label
Pine Creek as the "Tiadaghton" on their maps.<a name="FNanchor_30_32" id="FNanchor_30_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_32" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In fact, Adlum's
map of 1792, found among the papers of William Bingham, designates
the area east of Lycoming Creek as the "Old Purchase." Furthermore,
as is the case with Evans' map, Adlum does not apply
the Tiadaghton label to either Pine Creek or Lycoming Creek.<a name="FNanchor_31_33" id="FNanchor_31_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_33" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Two applications in 1769 for land in the New Purchase show that
the Tiadaghton, or in this case "Ticadaughton," can only be Lycoming
Creek. The application of Robert Galbreath (no. 1823)
is described as "Bounded on one side by the Proprietor's tract at
Lycoming." Martin Stover applied for the same tract (application
no. 2611), which is described as "below the mouth of Ticadaughton
Creek."<a name="FNanchor_32_34" id="FNanchor_32_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_34" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The copies of these two applications, together with the
copy of the survey, offer irrefutable proof of the validity of Lycoming's
claim.</p>

<p>Perhaps the final note is the action of the General Assembly of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on December 12, 1784.<a name="FNanchor_33_35" id="FNanchor_33_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_35" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The legislators
affirmed the judgments of the frontier journalists, whose recorded
journeys offer the best proof that the Lycoming is the Tiadaghton.
Prior to this action, the Provincial authorities had issued
a proclamation on September 20, 1773, prohibiting settlement west
of Lycoming Creek by white persons. Violators were to be apprehended
and tried. The penalties were real and quite severe: &pound;500
fine, twelve months in prison without bail, and a guarantee of twelve
months of exemplary conduct after release.<a name="FNanchor_34_36" id="FNanchor_34_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_36" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Court records, however,
fail to indicate any prosecutions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p><p>Finally, the latest scholar to delve into the complexities of the Stanwix
treaties, Professor Peter Marshall, says that there was no prolonged
and close discussion about the running of the treaty line in Pennsylvania
(the Tiadaghton question), no discussion in any way comparable
to that which took place over its location in New York.<a name="FNanchor_35_37" id="FNanchor_35_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_37" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In summary then, it appears that the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in
1768 was responsible for opening the West Branch Valley to settlement,
such settlement being stimulated by the opening of the Land
Office in Philadelphia on April 3, 1769. James Tilghman, secretary
of the Land Office, published the notice of his office's willingness "to
receive applications from all persons inclinable to take up lands in
the New Purchase."<a name="FNanchor_36_38" id="FNanchor_36_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_38" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The enthusiasm generated by the opening of
the Land Office is shown by the better than 2,700 applications received
on the very first day. However, the question of the Tiadaghton
came to be a source of real contention. The ambiguity of the Indian
references to the western boundary of the first Stanwix Treaty led
the eager settlers, who were seeking to legitimize claims in the area
between Lycoming and Pine creeks, to favor Pine Creek. There was
substance to the settlers' claim.</p>

<p>The significance of the boundary question to this study is better
understood when it is recognized that the so-called Fair Play system
of government in lands beyond the Provincial limits must have a
definable locale. It is this writer's firm conviction that Fair Play
territory extended from Lycoming Creek, on the north side of the
West Branch of the Susquehanna, to the Great Island, some five miles
west of Pine Creek. The foundation for the establishment of Lycoming
Creek as the Tiadaghton, and consequently, as the eastern
boundary of the Fair Play territory is apparent once all the evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
is examined. Aside from the comments of the Indians at the treaty
negotiations and Smith's <i>Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</i>,
there are only secondary accounts with little documentation to
sustain the Pine Creek argument.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Lycoming Creek claim is buttressed by
such primary sources as the journals of Weiser, Bartram, Spangenberg,
Ettwein, and Fithian, three of which were written before the
location of the Tiadaghton became a subject of dispute. Since none
of these men was seeking lands, they can be considered impartial observers.
Furthermore, the cartographic efforts of Lewis Evans and
John Adlum followed actual visits to the region and say nothing to
favor the Pine Creek view.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Indians were merely accepting an already accomplished
fact at the meeting in 1784. Dr. Paul A. W. Wallace says
that this would have been expected from the subservient, pacified
Indian. Regardless, the Provincial leadership made no effort to settle
the lands in what some called "the disputed territory" until after
the later agreement at Stanwix; in fact, they discouraged it.<a name="FNanchor_37_39" id="FNanchor_37_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_39" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The
simple desire for legitimacy gives us very little to go on in the light
of more than adequate documentation of the justice of the Lycoming
view.</p>

<p>This evidence might suggest changing the name of the long-revered
"Tiadaghton Elm" to the "Pine Creek Elm" and bringing to a close
the vexatious question of the Tiadaghton. However let us strike a
note of caution, if not humility. Indian place names had a way of
shifting, doubling, and moving, since they served largely as descriptive
terms and not as true place names. It is not at all unusual to find
the same name applied to several places or to find names migrating.
The Tiadaghton could have been Lycoming Creek to some Indians
at one time, and Pine Creek to others at the same or another time.
Consider, for example, that there were three Miami rivers in present
Ohio, which are now known as the Miami, the Little Miami, and
the Maumee. It hardly makes any real difference to the geography
of the Fair Play territory, or to the delimiting of its boundaries, which
stream was the Tiadaghton. Actually, it was the doubt about it
which drew in the squatters and created Fair Play. These settlers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
justified their contention that the Tiadaghton was Pine Creek by
moving into the territory and holding onto it. This may be reason
enough for calling the famous tree the Tiadaghton Elm, even if early
travelers and the proprietary officials said that the Tiadaghton was
Lycoming Creek.<a name="FNanchor_38_40" id="FNanchor_38_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_40" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The topography of the region also influenced the delineation of
what we call Fair Play territory. The jugular vein which supplies
the life-blood to this region is undoubtedly the West Branch of the
Susquehanna River. This branch of the great river, which drains
almost fifty per cent of the State, follows a northeasterly course of
some forty miles from the Great Island, which is just east of present
Lock Haven, to what is now Muncy, then turns southward.<a name="FNanchor_39_41" id="FNanchor_39_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_41" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The West Branch of the mighty Susquehanna, which has plagued
generations of residents with its spring floodings, was the primary
means of ingress and egress for the area. Rich bottom lands at the
mouths of Lycoming, Larrys, and Pine creeks drew the hardy pioneer
farmers, and here they worked the soil to provide the immediate
needs for survival. Hemmed in on the north by the plateau area of
the Appalachian front and on the south by the Bald Eagle Mountains,
these courageous pioneers of frontier democracy carved their future
out of the two-mile area (more often less) between those two forbidding
natural walls. With the best lands to be found around the
mouth of Pine Creek, which is reasonably close to the center of this
twenty-five-mile area, it seems quite natural that the major political,
social, and economic developments would take place in close proximity&mdash;and
they did.<a name="FNanchor_40_42" id="FNanchor_40_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_42" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, an area never exceeding two miles in width and spanning
some ten miles (presently from Jersey Shore to Lock Haven) was
the heartland of Fair Play settlement. Lycoming Creek, Larrys Creek,
and Pine Creek all run south into the West Branch, having channeled
breaks through the rolling valley which extends along the previously
defined territory.</p>

<p>"The land was ours before we were the land's," the poet said, and
it seems apropos of this moment in history.<a name="FNanchor_41_43" id="FNanchor_41_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_43" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Fair Play territory, possessed
before it was owned and operated under <i>de facto</i> rule, would
be some time in Americanizing the sturdy frontiersmen who came
to bring civilization to this wilderness.</p>

the Proclamation of 1763. Albert T. Volwiler, <i>George Croghan and the Westward
Movement, 1741-1782</i> (Cleveland, 1926), p. 250, really overstates his case, if the Fair
Play settlers are any example, when he claims that the Fort Stanwix line, by
setting a definite boundary, impeded the western advance. Establishing friendships
with the Indians and then persuading them to sell their lands proved valuable
to more than speculators, whose case Volwiler documents so well, as West Branch
settlements after 1768 will attest.</p></div>

Susquehanna</i> (Williamsport, 1889), p. 106. The full passage from the Bethlehem
Diary (now in the Moravian Archives) was translated by the late Dr. William
N. Schwarze for Dr. Paul A. W. Wallace, historian of the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission, as follows: "In the afternoon [June 8, New Style] our
brethren left that place [beyond Montoursville] and came in the evening to the
Limping Messenger on the Tiadachton Creek, where they spent the night." In the
<i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</i>, II (1878), 432 (hereafter cited
as <i>PMHB</i>), Zeisberger's account is translated in this manner: "In the afternoon
we proceeded on our journey, and at dusk came to the 'Limping Messenger,' or
Diadachton Creek [a note identifies this as Lycoming], and encamped for the night."
Here the error is in identifying the Limping Messenger with the stream. Meginness,
of course, repeated the error in his <i>Otzinachson</i> (1889), p. 106. Referring the passage
to Vernon H. Nelson of the Moravian Archives, through Dr. Wallace, resulted in
a clarification of the translation and the affirmation of the "Limping Messenger"
as a camp on the stream. In the Bethlehem Diary, under June 8, 1754, the sentence
appears as follows: "des Nachm. reissten unsre Brr Wieder von da weg u kamen
Abends zum hinckenden Boten an der Tiatachton Creek, u lagen da uber Nacht."
In the original travel journal the passage reads: "des Nachm. reissten wir wieder
von da weg, u kamen Abends zum <i>hinckenden Boten</i> an der Tiatachton Crick u
lagen da uber Nacht." De Schweinitz in his <i>Zeisberger</i> further confused the issue
in his description of the journey. He takes the adventurers (Zeisberger, Spangenburg,
Conrad Weiser, Shickellamy, and Andrew Montour) through the valley of
the Tiadaghton Creek on the Sheshequin Path to Onondaga (Syracuse). There
was an Indian path up Pine Creek, but it led to Niagara, not Onondaga.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_21" id="Footnote_19_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_21"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Dr. Bertin, former associate secretary of the Pennsylvania State Education
Association, adds nothing to the Meginness and Linn accounts, his probable
sources. He speaks of settlements as early as 1772, whereas it is a matter of record
that Cleary Campbell squatted in what is now north Lock Haven sometime shortly
after 1769. He refers to the establishment of homes, properly, but then goes on to
add churches and schools. The source for his "Children and elders met together
periodically to recite catechism to the preacher, who was a travelling missionary,
one being Phillip Fithian," was J. B. Linn. But Fithian, an extremely accurate
diarist, fails to mention the occasion during his one-week visit to this area in the
summer of 1775. However, the real value of this article is the editorial note by
T. Kenneth Wood on the Tiadaghton question. In it he refers to John Bartram's
journal of 1743, twenty-five years before the Stanwix Treaty at Rome, N. Y., with
the Iroquois, which recounts his travels with the Oneida Chief Shickellamy and
Conrad Weiser. Lewis Evans was also in the party, making notes for his map of
1749. The party, on its way to Onondaga (Syracuse), was approaching Lycoming
Creek at a point just south of Powys, via the Sheshequin Indian path. Bartram,
the first American botanist, who wrote in his journal nightly after checking with
his two guides, gives this account, T. Kenneth Wood (ed.), "Observations Made
By John Bartram In His Travels from Pennsylvania to Onondaga, Oswego and the
Lake Ontario in 1743," <i>Now and Then</i>, V (1936), 90: "Then down a hill to a run
and over a rich neck of land lying between it and the Tiadaughton." No contact
was made with Pine Creek. Dr. Wood contends in his note to the Bertin article,
and this writer is inclined to agree, that the Indian of 1743 and the Indian of 1768
were telling the truth and that the white settlers of 1768, and for sixteen years
thereafter, were wrong, either through guile and design or ignorance. He says,
"The original Indian principals signing the treaty had retreated westward and
sixteen years of fighting over the question (and possibly a few bribes) had settled
it to the white man's satisfaction. The Indians always had to yield or get out."
This is essentially the point which Dr. Wallace made to me in his letter of Feb.
16, 1961.</p></div>

<p>James Logan, president of the Proprietary Council of Pennsylvania,
1736-1738, once declared that "if the Scotch-Irish continue
to come they will make themselves masters of the Province."<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His
prediction, which was to be generally proven in the Province during

West Branch Valley during the Revolutionary period. The Scotch-Irish
were the dominant national or ethnic group in the Fair Play
territory from 1769 to 1784. This dominance is demonstrated in
Chart 1, which indicates the national origins of eighty families in the
Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>Not only were the Scotch-Irish the most numerous national stock
among the Fair Play settlers of the West Branch Valley, but they
also represented a plurality and almost a majority of the entire population.
The significance of this finding in terms of the "style of
life" of the Fair Play settlers cannot be over-emphasized. It influenced
the politics, the religion, the family patterns, and thus the
values of this frontier society.</p>

<p>Several other important conclusions can be drawn from this chart.
In contrast to the population of Pennsylvania in general and the
assumptions regarding frontier areas in particular, the English, rather
than the Germans, were the second most numerous national stock
group. The Germans, however, made up the third-largest segment
of the West Branch Valley population. The Scots, Welsh, Irish, and
a few French inhabitants formed the remaining sixteen per cent of
the population. Obviously, this was a dominantly Anglo-Saxon
Protestant area of settlement.</p>

<p>The impact of this Scotch-Irish hegemony upon the religion, politics,
family life, and social values in general will be dealt with in a later
chapter. However, it can be noted at this juncture that the strong-willed
individualism which characterized these sturdy people was as much
influenced by their national origin as by their experience on
the American frontier. Furthermore, Presbyterianism influenced and
was influenced by a developing democratic political system, which
paralleled the American Presbyterian system of popular rather than
hierarchical church government.<a name="FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A prominent immigration historian
has pointed out that "the theory of Presbyterian republicanism, as
a matter of church policy, could easily be reconciled with demands
of the more radical democrats of 1776."<a name="FNanchor_4_47" id="FNanchor_4_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_47" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Finally, the social life and
customs and, hence, the values of this frontier society were governed
for the most part by this majority group. Thus, dogmatic faith,
political equality, social and economic independence, respect for
education, and a tightly-knit pattern of family relationships express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
appropriately the institutional patterns by which the Scotch-Irish of
the West Branch operated.</p>

<p>It is interesting to contrast the national stock groupings of this
Susquehanna frontier with the results of a study of national origins
of the American population made by the American Council of Learned
Societies and published in 1932:<a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>From this comparison it can readily be seen that the national origins
of the Fair Play settlers in no way conform to either the national pattern
or the State pattern of just a few years later. Although this limited
frontier area can be recognized as having its own individual ratio
of component stocks, it is representative rather than unique in its
culture and values. The reaction of those of other national stocks
to the frontier experience buttresses the conclusion that their values
were influenced more by the frontier than by national origin. It is
this common reaction to the problems of the frontier which gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
rise to the conclusion that this West Branch Valley environment was
characterized by and that its inhabitants held values which Turner
evaluated as democratic. The nature of those democratic values is,
however, dealt with in greater detail in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>The American sources of emigration form the next question to be
considered in examining the origins of the Fair Play settlers. Lacking
adequate statistical data for a complete picture of migration in terms
of percentages, the following chart indicates only the probable origins
of the three most numerous national stock groupings in the Fair
Play territory:</p>

<p>Obviously, the primary sources for the West Branch settlements
were the lower Susquehanna Valley and southeastern Pennsylvania.
However, an appreciable number of English settlers appear to have
come originally from New Jersey to settle in what they called "Jersey
Shore," immediately east of the mouth of Pine Creek. One explanation
for the migration of the dominant stock, the Scotch-Irish,
is probably the fact that the Provincial government refused to sell
more lands in Lancaster and York counties to the Scotch-Irish. In
effect, they were driven to use squatter tactics in the Fair Play territory.<a name="FNanchor_7_50" id="FNanchor_7_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The internal origins of sixteen of these settlers can be verified in
either Meginness or Linn. Four came from Chester County, three each
from the Juniata Valley and Lancaster County, two each from Cumberland
County and New Jersey, and one each from Dauphin County
and from Orange County in New York. Nine of these settlers, incidentally,
were Scotch-Irish. Although these data are insufficient for
any valid generalization, they do conform to the characteristic migratory
trends indicated in Chart 3.</p>

<p>In analyzing the migration of settlers into the West Branch Valley
beyond the line of the "New Purchase," it becomes apparent that the
Scotch-Irish came from the fringe areas of settlement, whereas the
English and Germans tended to migrate from more settled areas. Furthermore,
the English migrants often came from outside the Province
of Pennsylvania, either from New Jersey or New York. In fact, if one
were to construct a pattern of concentric zones, with the core in the
southeastern corner of the Province and the lines radiating in a north-westerly
direction, the English would be found at the core, the
Germans in the next zone, and the Scotch-Irish in the outlying area.
This zoning offers no real contradiction of the usual pattern of Pennsylvania
migrations. However, when one combines the data of internal
movements with those of external origins, certain contradictions do
appear. The most noteworthy of these is, of course, the prominence
of English settlers on this Fair Play frontier vis-&agrave;-vis the Germans.</p>

<p>Since the Pennsylvania frontiersmen of the Wyoming Valley were
of English stock, and immigrated from New England, it might have
been assumed that some of these Connecticut settlers came into the
West Branch Valley. Here, however, all evidence points to the fact
that Connecticut settlers did not migrate west of Muncy, which is
located at the juncture of Muncy Creek and the West Branch of the
Susquehanna River (where the bend in the river turns into a directly
western pattern). Thus the Connecticut boundary dispute of 1769-1775,
which erupted into the Pennamite Wars, did not involve the
Fair Play settlers.<a name="FNanchor_8_51" id="FNanchor_8_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Nevertheless, at least one Fair Play settler looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
forward to the possibility of an advance of the Connecticut settlement
along the West Branch.<a name="FNanchor_9_52" id="FNanchor_9_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_52" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The impact of events upon the settlement of the Fair Play territory
is particularly apparent when one examines the periods of
immigration to and emigration from the region. Three events seemed
to have had the greatest influence upon the immigration: the Treaty of
Fort Stanwix in 1768, which extended the Provincial limits to Lycoming
Creek in this region, and the resultant opening of the Land Office
for claims in the "New Purchase" on April 3, 1769;<a name="FNanchor_10_53" id="FNanchor_10_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_53" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the almost complete
evacuation of the territory in the "Great Runaway" of the summer
of 1778, which was prompted by Indian attacks and the fear of a
great massacre comparable to the "Wyoming Valley Massacre" of that
same year;<a name="FNanchor_11_54" id="FNanchor_11_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_54" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and finally, the Stanwix Treaty of 1784, which brought the
Fair Play area within the limits of the Province.<a name="FNanchor_12_55" id="FNanchor_12_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_55" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The first Stanwix Treaty, made by Sir William Johnson with the
Six Nations in November of 1768, extended the legitimate line of
English colonial settlement from the line established by the Proclamation
of 1763 to a point on the West Branch of the Susquehanna
River at the mouth of Lycoming Creek (the Tiadaghton, as it was
so ambiguously labeled).<a name="FNanchor_13_56" id="FNanchor_13_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_56" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This extension, ostensibly for the purpose
of providing lands for the colonial veterans of the French and Indian
War, became a boon to speculators and an inducement to the Scotch-Irish
squatters who took lands beyond the limits of this "New Purchase"
in what was to become the Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1778 the war whoop once again caused the settlers
of the West Branch Valley to flee from their homes for fear of
a repetition of the Wyoming Massacre. The peril of the moment is
vividly described in this communication to the Executive Council in
Philadelphia from Colonel Samuel Hunter, commander of Fort Augusta:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Carnage at Wioming, the devastations and murders upon
the West branch of Susquehanna, On Bald Eagle Creek, and
in short throughout the whole County to within a few
miles of these Towns (the recital of which must be shocking)
I suppose must have before now have reached your
ears, if not you may figure yourselves men, women, and
children, Butchered and scalped, many of them after being
promised quarters, and some scalped alive, of which we have
miserable Instances amongst us.... I have only to add that
A few Hundreds of men well armed and immediately sent
to our relief would prevent much bloodshed, confusion and
devastation ... as the appearance of being supported would
call back many of our fugitives to save their Harvest for their
subsistence, rather than suffer the inconveniences which reason

unprofitable Burthen.<a name="FNanchor_14_57" id="FNanchor_14_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_57" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>Robert Covenhoven, who lived at the mouth of the Loyalsock Creek
and who fled to Sunbury (Fort Augusta) also, described the flight:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Such a sight I never saw in my life. Boats, canoes, hog-troughs,
rafts hastily made of dry sticks, every sort of floating
article, had been put in requisition, and were crowded
with women, children, and plunder. There were several
hundred people in all.... The whole convoy arrived safely
at Sunbury, leaving the entire range of farms along the West
Branch to the ravages of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_15_58" id="FNanchor_15_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_58" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>In this eighteenth-century Dunkirk, the West Branch Valley was
practically cleared of settlers.</p>

<p>The Indians, it is true, proved troublesome to the entire advancing
American frontier; but unlike the French, whose menacing forts had
been removed in the recent wars, the Indians were unable to halt the
westward penetration. An expedition under the leadership of Colonel
Thomas Hartley was sent out expressly for the purpose of boosting
morale in the West Branch Valley following the Wyoming Massacre
and the Great Runaway. Colonel Hartley's letter to Thomas McKean,
chief justice of Pennsylvania and a member of the Continental Congress,
gives bitter testimony to the conditions which he observed in
September of 1778:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You heard of the Distresses of these Frontiers they are
truly great&mdash;The People which we found were Difident and
timid The Panick had not yet left them&mdash;many a wealthy
Family reduced to Poverty &amp; without a home, some had
lost their Husbands their children or Friends&mdash;all was
gloomy.... the Barbarians do now and then attack an unarmed
man a Helpless Mother or Infant....</p></div>

<p>The colonel indicated, however, that strong militia support and
some offensive action would restore confidence and cause the people
to return to the valley. His interpretation of the significance of his
mission is quite clearly stated in the conclusion of his letter: "We
shall not have it in our Power to gain Honour or Laurels on these
Frontiers but we have the Satisfaction to think we save our Country...."
Hartley's solution to the Indian problem, which had driven
off the settlers, was to expel them "beyond the Lakes" excepting only
the more civilized Tuscaroras and Oneidas.<a name="FNanchor_16_59" id="FNanchor_16_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_59" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Despite the danger from the Indians, the Fair Play settlers began
trickling back to their homes, or what was left of them, toward the
end of the Revolutionary War. Once the war was ended and the Fair
Play territory was annexed by subsequent purchase, the mass movement
of settlers to the West Branch Valley resumed.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Dr. Wallace in his <i>Conrad Weiser</i> assesses one John
Henry Lydius with the major responsibility for the Indian massacres
in central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Wallace notes that Lydius'
Connecticut purchase from the Indians in 1754 caused "war between
Pennsylvania and Connecticut and ... [precipitated] the Massacre of
Wyoming in 1778." This massacre, as West Branch historians know,
had its subsequent impact on the West Branch Valley in the Great
Runaway, although the Winters Massacre of June 10, 1778, which
prompted the evacuation of the valley, actually preceded the Wyoming
affair.<a name="FNanchor_17_60" id="FNanchor_17_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_60" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, the purchase of the remaining Indian lands in Pennsylvania
(except for the small corner of the Erie Triangle) was made on
October 3, 1784, in a second Stanwix Treaty. This accession ended the
Pennsylvania boundary dispute with the Six Nations; and it also
ended the need for any extra-legal system of government in the West
Branch Valley, for this new treaty encompassed the Fair Play territory.<a name="FNanchor_18_61" id="FNanchor_18_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_61" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
However, this treaty raised the troublesome Tiadaghton question
once again, a question only partly resolved by the Legislature's
designation of Lycoming Creek as the Tiadaghton and the recognition
of the squatters' right of pre-emption to their settlements along
the West Branch of the Susquehanna.<a name="FNanchor_19_62" id="FNanchor_19_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_62" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The land office was opened
for the sale of this purchase July 1, 1785; by 1786 fifty heads of families
were listed for State taxes in Northumberland County.<a name="FNanchor_20_63" id="FNanchor_20_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_63" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Approximately
fifty per cent of these taxables had been in the area earlier.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only significant nationality trend to be noted in this
important sequence of events is the tenacity of the Scotch-Irish and
the subsequent increase of English and German settlers following
this last "New Purchase."<a name="FNanchor_21_64" id="FNanchor_21_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_64" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Over half of the taxables in Pine Creek
Township, the new designation for much of the Fair Play territory
after it became an official part of the Province, were Scotch-Irish. As
a result, these Scots from the north of Ireland continued to maintain
their position of leadership even after the area was included in the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The reasons for migrating to the West Branch Valley in this fifteen-year
period from 1769 to 1784 were varied and numerous. For the
most part, the various nationality groups which emigrated from
Europe came for economic opportunity and because of religious and
political persecutions. Their movement to the frontier regions was
prompted by similar problems. In fact, much the same as the earlier
settlers of Jamestown and Plymouth, the squatters of the West Branch
Valley came for gain and for God. Furthermore, the promise of
Penn's "Holy Experiment," in which men of diverse backgrounds could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
live together peacefully in religious freedom and political equality,
encouraged them to come to Pennsylvania. However, once the dominant
group of the Fair Play frontier, the Scotch-Irish, arrived in Pennsylvania,
they found themselves unsuited to the settled areas. The
natural enemy of the English, who had oppressed them at home, these
settlers soon found themselves repeating the Old World conflicts. In
addition, the German Pietists caused them further embarrassment in
their new homes. Their Calvinism, fierce political independence, and
earnest desire for land and opportunity soon made them <i>personae
non gratae</i> in the established areas. Hence, they migrated to the frontier
areas and even beyond the limits of Provincial interference and
control.<a name="FNanchor_22_65" id="FNanchor_22_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_65" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The paucity of population data makes impossible any extensive
analysis of the stability and mobility of the Fair Play settlers. However,
the tax lists, both in the published archives and in the files of
the county commissioners in Northumberland County, offer limited
evidence for the early years, though they provide ample data for the
years after 1773. Prior to the Great Runaway in 1778, tax lists are
available for the entire county of Northumberland; the lists simply
indicate the taxable's township, acreage, and tax. Records in the
Northumberland County courthouse give the assessments for 1773,
1774, 1776, and 1778.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that the Fair Play territory was outside the Provincial
limits until after the purchase of Fort Stanwix in 1784, the
assessment lists give only those persons residing within Northumberland
County. As a result, there were only six to twelve settlers who
associated with the Fair Play men who were included in the lists for
1773-1778. Chart 4 indicates the names, national origins, and years
listed for those settlers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>From these limited data one obviously concludes that the Scotch-Irish
were not only the most numerous but also the most persistent
of these frontiersmen. Also, nine of these men, that is all except
Clark, Jones, and King, appear on the tax lists for Northumberland
County for the year 1785.<a name="FNanchor_24_67" id="FNanchor_24_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_67" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Interestingly enough, six of these nine
were Scotch-Irish; and although our sample is limited, it is readily
apparent that the stalwart Scots had a way of "hanging on." It would
be presumptuous to conclude that seventy-five per cent of the residents
before 1778 returned by 1785; but it is fact that some forty
families had made improvements in the area by 1773 when William
Cooke was sent out by the Land Office to "Warn the People of[f] the
unpurchased Land."<a name="FNanchor_25_68" id="FNanchor_25_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_68" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Furthermore, as indicated earlier, some fifty
families appear on the assessments for 1786, more than half of whom
had been in the region before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p><p>Any effort to analyze the population in terms of stability and mobility
runs head-on into the creation of new townships in the 1780's,
the inability to establish death rates for this frontier, and the inadequacy
of probate records. The result is that the data are intuitively
rather than statistically sound. Chart 5 offers a comparison of tax
lists over a period of nine years as the basis for some conclusions regarding
the stability and mobility of the Fair Play settlers.</p>

<p>Except for the 1783-84 figures, all of the tax data are for State taxes.
The exception is the listing for the federal supply tax in 1783-84.
The steady growth rate of the area is easily recognizable both in raw
figures and in percentages. Beginning with an increase of a little more
than seven per cent between the first two listings, we find a seventy
per cent increase in the final figures. The tremendous increase in the
last two assessments may be due to the purchase of 1784 and the subsequent
legitimizing of claims through the establishment of pre-emption
rights.</p>

<p>The stability of the population is particularly noted in the consistently
high percentage of residents with some tenure in the valley.
Furthermore, the apparent contradiction of this statement by the
decline to fourteen residents in the 1786 listing who had once left
and then returned is offset when one examines the neighboring township
assessments for that same year. Here fourteen additional names
of former Fair Play settlers are to be found which would sustain the
characteristic pattern of tenure. The statistical problem is complicated
by the creation of new townships following the purchase of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
1784. Pine Creek and Lycoming were the new designations for the
former Fair Play territory, Pine Creek running from the creek of
that same name west, and Lycoming extending from Pine Creek east
to Lycoming Creek.</p>

<p>Petitions from the area in 1778, 1781, and 1784 give a similar
picture. Almost half of the names which are found on the tax lists
appear on two or more of these appeals. These include a distress
petition in June of 1778, and petitions asking recognition of pre-emption
rights in 1781 and 1784.<a name="FNanchor_27_70" id="FNanchor_27_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_70" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The signatures on the petitions
range in number from thirty-nine to fifty-one, and at least twenty-four
of these settlers signed two or more of these documents. The very
nature of these petitions, particularly the later ones, indicates the
tremendous desire on the part of these sturdy pioneers to remain
in or return to their homes in the West Branch Valley. Here too,
however, this tenacity of purpose is not strictly confined to the
Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>What conclusions can be drawn from this analysis of the demographic
factors in the Fair Play settlement? Particularly evident is
the dominance of the Scotch-Irish, who numerically composed the
greatest national stock group in the population. This dominance, as
we have already noted, greatly influenced the political and social
institutions of the area. Secondly, one might consider the numbers
of English settlers, as compared with the number of Germans, surprising.
As a matter of fact, if one adds the numbers of Scots and
Welsh inhabitants to the English and Scotch-Irish, the result is an
"English" percentage of seventy-seven and one half for the entire
population. Thus it is quite logical to assume that English customs
and language would prevail, and they did. Incidentally, it should be
added that the "English" nature of the population, combined with
the Scotch-Irish plurality, meant that the Scotch-Irish were more representative
of this frontier than they were innovators of its customs
and values.</p>

<p>If a majority of the Fair Play settlers came from the British Isles,
from where did they emigrate in America? Here it is quite clear that
these frontiersmen were predominantly from the lower Susquehanna
Valley and southeastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was to them a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
land of liberty and opportunity;<a name="FNanchor_28_71" id="FNanchor_28_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_71" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and when they failed to find these
privileges in the settled areas, they moved out on the frontier where
they could make their own rules, that is to say, establish their own
familiar institutions. The result was the Fair Play system.</p>

<p>Although the Fair Play settlers came to America and central Pennsylvania
for the usual political, economic, and social reasons, the two
Stanwix treaties and the Indian raids of 1778 had the most influence
on population fluctuations. The pioneers came into the territory
over-reaching the limits of the "New Purchase" of 1768. They were
driven out, almost to a man, in the Great Runaway of 1778. And
finally, they returned after the second "New Purchase" in 1784, which
resulted in the recognition of their pre-emption claims for their
earlier illegal settlements. It is interesting to note that pre-emption
claims were recognized in the West Branch Valley some forty-five years
prior to federal legislation to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_29_72" id="FNanchor_29_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_72" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Despite fluctuations in the population, the Scotch-Irish were able
to maintain their hold over the valley and thus influence the pattern
of development for this frontier outpost. Horace Walpole, addressing
the English Parliament during the American Revolution, said, "There
is no use crying about it. Cousin America has run off with a Presbyterian
parson, and that is the end of it."<a name="FNanchor_30_73" id="FNanchor_30_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_73" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The Scotch-Irish with
their Presbyterianism had run off with the West Branch Valley as
well; and their independent spirit would see them in the foreground
of the "noblest rupture in the history of mankind." That independent
spirit and leadership is particularly noted in the political system
which they established along the West Branch of the Susquehanna
River. Their "Fair Play system" is the primary concern of the next
chapter.</p>

<h3 class="ity"><big>The Politics of Fair Play</big></h3>


<p>The political system of these predominantly Scotch-Irish
squatters in the Susquehanna Valley, along the West Branch,
offers a vivid demonstration of the impact of the frontier on
the development of democratic institutions. Occupying lands beyond
the reach of the Provincial legislature, with some forty families of
mixed national origin in residence by 1773, these frontier "outlaws"
had to devise some solution to the question of authority in their
territory.<a name="FNanchor_1_74" id="FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_74" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Their solution was the extra-legal creation of <i>de facto</i>
rule historically known as the Fair Play system. The following is
a contemporary description of that system:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There existed a great number of locations of the third of
April, 1769, for the choicest lands on the West Branch of Susquehanna,
between the mouths of <i>Lycoming</i> and <i>Pine creeks</i>;
but the proprietaries, from extreme caution, the result of that
experience, which had also produced the very penal laws of
1768, and 1769, and the proclamation already stated, had
prohibited any surveys being made beyond the <i>Lycoming</i>.
In the mean time, in violation of all law, a set of hardy adventurers,
had from time to time, seated themselves on this
doubtful territory. They made improvements, and formed
a very considerable population. It is true, so far as regarded
the rights to real property, they were not under the protection
of the laws of the country; and were we to adopt the
visionary theories of some philosophers, who have drawn
their arguments from a supposed state of nature, we might
be led to believe that the state of these people would have
been a state of continual warfare; and that in contests for
property the weakest must give way to the strongest. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
prevent the consequences, real or supposed, of this state of
things, they formed a mutual compact among themselves.
They annually elected a tribunal, in rotation, of three of
their settlers, whom they called <i>fair play men</i>, who were to
decide all controversies, and settle disputed boundaries.
From their decision there was no appeal. There could be
no resistance. The decree was enforced by the whole body,
who started up in mass, at the mandate of the court, and
execution and eviction was as sudden, and irresistible as the
judgment. Every new comer was obliged to apply to this
powerful tribunal, and upon his solemn engagement to
submit in all respects, <i>to the law of the land</i>, he was permitted
to take possession of some vacant spot. Their decrees
were, however, just; and when their settlements were recognized
by law, and <i>fair play</i> had ceased, their decisions were
received in evidence, and confirmed by judgments of courts.<a name="FNanchor_2_75" id="FNanchor_2_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_75" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></div>

<p>The idea of authority from the people was nothing new; in fact,
it is as old as the Greeks. Nor is the concept of a "social compact,"
here implied, particularly novel to the American scene. The theory
was that people hitherto unconnected assembled and gave their consent
to be governed by a certain ruler or rulers under some particular
form of government.<a name="FNanchor_3_76" id="FNanchor_3_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_76" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Theoretically justified by John Locke in his
persuasive defense of the Glorious Revolution, it had been practiced
in Plymouth, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire,
where practical necessity had required it for settlements occasionally
made outside charter limits. The frontier, whether in New England
or in the West Branch Valley, created a practical necessity which
made popular consent the basis of an actual government.</p>

<p>They were not "covenanters" in the Congregational sense of having
brought an established church with them to the Fair Play territory.
But the Fair Play settlers understood and subscribed to the
principle of popular control, which was fundamental to such solemnly
made and properly ratified agreements. Separated from the authority
of the crown, detached from the authority of the hierarchy of the
church by the Protestant Reformation, possessing no American tradition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of extensive political experience, these settlers could only depend
upon themselves as proper authorities for their own political system.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the great majority of the settlers who came to the
Fair Play territory came from families who had left their homes in
the old country to escape political, economic, and social restrictions,
only to be made unwelcome in their new homes in the settled areas
of Pennsylvania. Displaced persons in a new country, they were
forced by lives of conflict to seek better opportunity by moving to
undeveloped lands. As a result, they settled along the West Branch of
the Susquehanna, beyond the authority of the crown and outside
the pressures of the Provincial legislature.</p>

<p>If man is a predatory beast in his natural state, a belief some
expressed in the eighteenth century, then it follows naturally that
every society must have some agency of authority and control. The
universally standardized solution to the problem of social control
is government. The Fair Play system was the answer on this Susquehanna
frontier to the need for some legitimate agency of force.<a name="FNanchor_4_77" id="FNanchor_4_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_77" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
This system vested authority in the people through annual elections
of a tribunal of three of their number. The members of the tribunal
were given quasi-executive, legislative, and judicial powers over all
the settlers in the West Branch Valley "beyond the purchase line."<a name="FNanchor_5_78" id="FNanchor_5_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_78" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Although no record of any of these elections has been preserved,
the composition of the Fair Play tribunal in 1776 has been established
and verified by subsequent reviews of land claims in the county<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
courts.<a name="FNanchor_6_79" id="FNanchor_6_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_79" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Also, two of the members of the tribunal of 1775 are identified
in a pre-emption claim made before the Lycoming County Court
in 1797.<a name="FNanchor_7_80" id="FNanchor_7_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_80" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is interesting to note that among these five men are
represented the three most prominent national stock groups in the
area, with the Scotch-Irish, as our earlier sample demonstrated, in
the majority.</p>

<p>Lacking returns of the annual elections of the tribunal and minutes
of its actual meetings, we have only Smith's <i>Laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania</i>, petitions from the Fair Play settlers, and the
subsequent review of land questions by the Northumberland and
Lycoming County courts to evaluate the tribunal, its members, and
its procedures. However, these data are more than adequate in
giving us a picture of this <i>de facto</i>, though illegal, rule, which existed
in the West Branch Valley until the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784
brought the territory under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The composition
of the electorate varied with the fluctuations in population
caused by the two Stanwix treaties, the Revolution, and the Great
Runaway.</p>

<p>Since property and religious qualifications were the primary prerequisites
to voting at this time, it seems logical to assume that a
similar basis for suffrage operated in the West Branch Valley.<a name="FNanchor_8_81" id="FNanchor_8_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_81" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Having
no regular church&mdash;the first, a Presbyterian, was not organized
until 1792&mdash;property qualifications appear to have been the basis for
what, in this area, was practically universal manhood suffrage. Due<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to the fact that the entire settlement consisted of squatters, practically
all of the heads of households were property holders, regardless
of the questionable legality of their holdings. The tax lists indicate
holdings of some 100 to 300 acres on the average for residents, so it
is particularly difficult to know whether or not a minimum holding
requirement prevailed. The Provincial suffrage requirement in this
period was generally fifty acres of land or &pound;50 of personal property.<a name="FNanchor_9_82" id="FNanchor_9_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_82" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Although this study encompasses a fifteen-year period from 1769
to 1784, it appears that the Fair Play system functioned for about
five years, from 1773 to 1778. This is due to the fact that only "fourty
Improvements,"<a name="FNanchor_10_83" id="FNanchor_10_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_83" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> meaning forty family settlements, existed in the
area by 1773, and that following the Great Runaway of 1778, the
territory was almost devoid of settlers. The void was filled, however,
when settlers began returning toward the end of the Revolution and
following the accession of the territory in the second Stanwix Treaty,
in 1784. Thus, for all practical purposes, the functioning of the Fair
Play system was confined to this more limited time. Furthermore,
the system was supplemented in 1776 by the introduction of the
Committee of Safety, and later that year by the Council of Safety.<a name="FNanchor_11_84" id="FNanchor_11_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_84" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>As is indicated in Smith's <i>Laws</i>, annual meetings were held to
select the governing tribunal of three for the ensuing year. Generally
convened at some readily accessible place, these sessions were presumably
held in the open or at one of the frontier forts erected in
the area: Fort Antes, across the river from Jersey Shore; or Fort
Horn, located on the south side of the Susquehanna about eight
miles west of Jersey Shore. There were frontier forts in the vicinity
of the present Muncy&mdash;Fort Muncy&mdash;and Lock Haven&mdash;Fort Reed;
but Fort Muncy was some twenty-odd miles east of the Fair Play
territory and Fort Reed was beyond the Great Island at its western
extremity. As a result, these outposts were unlikely meeting places
for the tribunal or for its election.<a name="FNanchor_12_85" id="FNanchor_12_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_85" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Unfortunately, there is no
recorded evidence of a specific meeting of the Fair Play men.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>The authority of the Fair Play tribunal extended across the entire
territory from Lycoming Creek to the Great Island on the north side
of the West Branch of the Susquehanna. However, most of the disputed
cases, which can be verified by subsequent court reviews in
either Northumberland or Lycoming counties, seem to have involved
land claims in the area between Lycoming and Pine creeks.
The tribunal accepted or rejected claims for settlement in the area
and decided boundary questions and other controversies among
settlers.<a name="FNanchor_13_86" id="FNanchor_13_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_86" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> As to a specific code of laws, there is none of record.
However, the cases subsequently reviewed in the established county
courts refer to some of their regular practices. For example, any man
who left his improvement for six weeks without leaving someone to
continue it, lost his right to the improvement;<a name="FNanchor_14_87" id="FNanchor_14_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_87" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> any man who went
into the army could count on the Fair Play men (the tribunal) to
protect his property;<a name="FNanchor_15_88" id="FNanchor_15_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_88" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> any man who sought land in the territory was
obliged to obtain not only the approval of the Fair Play men but
also of his nearest potential neighbors;<a name="FNanchor_16_89" id="FNanchor_16_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_89" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the summary process
of ejectment which the Fair Play men exercised was real and certain
and sometimes supported by the militia.<a name="FNanchor_17_90" id="FNanchor_17_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_90" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The specific membership of the Fair Play tribunal is rather difficult
to ascertain due to its failure to keep minutes of its proceedings and
the absence of any recorded code. However, as indicated earlier,<a name="FNanchor_18_91" id="FNanchor_18_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_91" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the existence of the tribunal between the years 1773 and 1778, and its
actual composition in 1775 and 1776, have already been established
from the review of its decisions by the Circuit Court of Lycoming
County. Assuming the principle of rotation from a contemporary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
description, some eighteen settlers held the positions of authority
during the years noted.<a name="FNanchor_19_92" id="FNanchor_19_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_92" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The cases reviewed reveal the names of five
of these eighteen. Recognizing the limitations of our twenty-eight
per cent sampling, however, it is interesting to note that the three
major national stocks are represented in this restricted sample. Furthermore,
as was mentioned previously,<a name="FNanchor_20_93" id="FNanchor_20_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_93" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the Scotch-Irish settlers,
being in the majority, enjoyed the majority representation on the
tribunal. An analysis of leadership in the territory, to be developed
more fully later, leads one to conclude that the Scotch-Irish, in the
main, were the political leaders of the area.<a name="FNanchor_21_94" id="FNanchor_21_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_94" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>A diligent search of some sixty cases in the Court of Common
Pleas in both Northumberland and Lycoming counties yielded some
documentary evidence regarding the procedures of the Fair Play
tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_22_95" id="FNanchor_22_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_95" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Three cases in Lycoming County and one from Northumberland
County contain depositions which describe the activities
of the Fair Play men in some detail. One case, <i>Hughes</i> vs. <i>Dougherty</i>,
was appealed to the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth. All of
the cases deal with the question of title to lands in the Fair Play
territory following the purchase of these lands at the Treaty of
Fort Stanwix in 1784. The depositions taken in conjunction with
these cases indicate the processes of settlement and ejectment, in
addition to the policies regarding land tenure. The fairness of the
Fair Play decisions is noted by the fact that the regular courts concurred
with the earlier judgments of the tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_23_96" id="FNanchor_23_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_96" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>An anecdote involving one of the Fair Play men, Peter Rodey,
illustrates the nature of this frontier justice. According to legend,
Chief Justice McKean of the State Supreme Court was holding court in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
this district, and, curious about the principles or code of the Fair Play
men, he inquired about them of Peter Rodey, a former member of
the tribunal. Rodey, unable to recall the details of the code, simply
replied: "All I can say is, that since your Honor's coorts have come
among us, <i>fair play</i> has entirely ceased, and law has taken its place."<a name="FNanchor_24_97" id="FNanchor_24_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_97" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The justice of "fair play" and the nature of the system can be
seen from an analysis of the cases reviewed subsequently in the established
courts. As mentioned previously, these cases describe the
procedures regarding settlement, land tenure, and ejectment. Although
no recorded code of laws has been located, references to
"resolutions of the Fair Play men" regularly appear in the depositions
and summaries of these cases.<a name="FNanchor_25_98" id="FNanchor_25_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_98" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> According to Leyburn, a customary
"law" concerning settlement rights operated on the frontier, particularly
among the Scotch-Irish.<a name="FNanchor_26_99" id="FNanchor_26_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_99" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This "law" recognized three settlement
rights: "corn right," which established claims to 100 acres for
each acre of grain planted; "tomahawk right," which marked off the
area claimed by deadening trees at the boundaries of the claim; and,
"cabin right," which confirmed the claim by the construction of a
cabin upon the premises. If the decisions of the regular courts are
at all indicative, Fair Play settlement was generally based upon
"cabin right." However, the frequent allusion to "improvements"
implies some secondary consideration to what Leyburn has defined
as "corn right."</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Hughes</i> vs. <i>Dougherty</i>, the significance of "improvements,"
or "corn rights," vis-&agrave;-vis "cabin rights" is particularly noted.<a name="FNanchor_27_100" id="FNanchor_27_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_100" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
The following summary of that case, found in <i>Pennsylvania Reports</i>,
emphasizes that significance, in addition to defining a Fair Play
"code" pertaining to land tenure:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THIS was an ejectment for 324 acres of land, part of the
Indian lands in <i>Northumberland</i> county.</p>

<p>The plaintiff claimed under a warrant issued on the 2d
<i>May</i> 1785, for the premises, and a survey made thereon upon
the 10th <i>January</i> 1786. The defendant, on the 20th <i>June</i>
1785, entered a caveat against the claims of the plaintiff, and
on the 5th <i>October</i> following, took out a warrant for the land
in dispute, on which he was then settled. Both claimed the
pre-emption under the act of 21st <i>December</i> 1784,<a name="FNanchor_28_101" id="FNanchor_28_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_101" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and on
the evidence given the facts appeared to be:</p>

<p>That in 1773, one <i>James Hughes</i>, a brother of the plaintiff,
settled on the lands in question and made some small improvements.
In the next year he enlarged his improvement,
and cut logs to build an house. In the winter following he
went to his father's in <i>Donegal</i> in <i>Lancaster</i> county, and died
there. His elder brother <i>Thomas</i> was at that time settled on
the Indian land, and one of the "Fair Play Men," who had
assembled together and made a resolution, (which they
agreed to enforce as the law of the place,) that "if any person
was absent from his "settlement for six weeks he should forfeit
his right." [Quotation marks as published.]</p>

<p>In the spring of 1775 the defendant came to the settlement,
and was advised by the Fair Play Men to settle on the premises
which <i>Hughes</i> had left; this he did, and built a cabin.
The plaintiff soon after came, claiming it in right of his
brother, and aided by <i>Thomas Hughes</i>, took possession of
the cabin; but the defendant collecting his friends, an affray
ensued, in which <i>Hughes</i> was beaten off and the defendant
left in possession. He continued to improve, built an house
and stable, and cleared about ten acres. In 1778 he was
driven off by the enemy and entered into the army. At the
close of the war, both plaintiff and defendant returned to
the settlement, each claiming the land in dispute.</p>

<p>The warrant was taken out in the name of <i>James Hughes</i>,
(the father of the plaintiff who is since dead,) for the benefit
of his children.</p>

<p>After argument by Mr. <i>Charles Smith</i> and Mr. <i>Duncan</i> for
the plaintiff, and Mr. <i>Daniel Smith</i> and Mr. <i>Read</i> for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
defendant, Justice <i>Shippen</i> in the charge of the court to the
jury, said&mdash;</p>

<p>The dispute here, is between a first improvement, and a
subsequent but much more valuable improvement. But
neither of the parties has any legal or equitable right, but
under the act of the 21st <i>December</i> 1784. The settlement
on this land was against law. It was an offence that tended to
involve this country in blood. But the merit and sufferings
of the actual settlers cancelled the offence, and the legislature,
mindful of their situation, provided this special act for their
relief. The preamble recites their "resolute stand and sufferings,"
as deserving a right of pre-emption. The legislature
had no eye to any person who was not one of the occupiers
after the commencement of the war, and a transient settler
removed, (no matter how,) is not an object of the law. This
is our construction of the act. <i>James Hughes</i> under whom
the plaintiff claims, died before the war, the other occupied
the premises after, and in the language of the act, "stood and
suffered." If this construction be right, the cause is at an end.</p>

<p>Besides, the plaintiff claims as the heir of <i>Thomas</i>, who
was the heir of <i>James</i>, the first settler. I will not say that the
fair play men could make a law to bind the settlers; but they
might by agreement bind themselves. Now <i>Thomas</i> was one
of these, and was bound by his conduct, from disputing the
right of the defendant.</p>

<p>This warrant it seems, is taken out in the name of the
father, and it is said, as a trustee for his children. It is sometimes
done for the benefit of all concerned. If this be the
case, it may be well enough; but still it is not so regular,
as it might have been[.] With these observations, we submit
it to you.</p>

<p class="signing">Verdict for the defendant.<a name="FNanchor_29_102" id="FNanchor_29_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_102" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This case, although originated in the Northumberland County
Court in 1786, was appealed to the State Supreme Court, where the
lower court decision was affirmed in 1791. The summary runs the
gamut of Fair Play procedures from settlement, through questions
of tenure, to ejectment. Its completeness indicates its usefulness.
Partial and occasional depositions in the other cases cited help to
round out the picture of the Fair Play "code."</p>

<p>For example, the right of settlement included not only the approval
of the Fair Play men, but also the acceptance of the prospective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
landholder by his neighbors. Allusions to this effect are made in the
Coldren deposition as well as in the Huff-Latcha case. Eleanor
Coldren's deposition, made at Sunbury, June 7, 1797, concerns the
disputed title to certain lands of her deceased husband, Abraham
Dewitt, opposite the Great Island. Her comments about neighbor
approval demonstrate the point. She says, for instance, that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... in the Spring of 1775, Henry Antes and Cookson Long,
two of the Fair-Play Men, with others, were at the deponent's
house, next below Barnabas Bonner's Improvement, where
Deponent's Husband kept a Tavern, and heard Antes and
Long say that they (meaning the Fair-Play Men) and the
Neighbors of the Settlement had unanimously agreed that
James Irvin, James Parr, Abraham Dewitt and Barnabas
Bonner should ... have their Improvement Rights fitted....</p></div>

<p>She speaks of the resolution of the claims problem "as being the
unanimous agreement of the Neighbors and Fair-Play Men...."<a name="FNanchor_30_103" id="FNanchor_30_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_103" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>William King, who temporarily claimed part of the land involved
in the dispute between Edmund Huff and Jacob Latcha, also refers
to neighbor approval in his deposition taken in that case. He said,
"I first went to Edmund Huff, then to Thomas Kemplen, Samuel
Dougherty, William McMeans, and Thomas Ferguson, and asked if
they would accept me as a neighbor...."<a name="FNanchor_31_104" id="FNanchor_31_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_104" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Land tenure policy is noted by this same William King in the
case of <i>James Grier</i> vs. <i>William Tharpe</i>. Repeating what we have
already pointed out in the case of <i>Hughes</i> vs. <i>Dougherty</i>, King
testified that "there was a law among the Fair-play men by which
any man, who absented himself for the space of six weeks, lost his
right to his improvement."<a name="FNanchor_32_105" id="FNanchor_32_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_105" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the Huff-Latcha case, King recounts
the case of one Joseph Haines who "had once a right ... but had
forfeited his right by the Fair-play law...."<a name="FNanchor_33_106" id="FNanchor_33_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_106" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The forfeiture rule was tempered, however, in cases involving
military service. Bratton Caldwell's deposition in <i>Grier</i> vs. <i>Tharpe</i>
is a case in point. Caldwell, one of the Fair Play men in 1776, declared
that "Greer went into the army in 1776 and was a wagon-master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
till the fall of 1778.... In July, 1778, the Runaway, John
Martin, had come on the land in his absence. The Fair-play men put
Greer in possession. If a man went into the army, the Fair-play men
protected his property."<a name="FNanchor_34_107" id="FNanchor_34_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_107" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Meginness mentions a similar decision
in the case of John Toner and Morgan Sweeney.<a name="FNanchor_35_108" id="FNanchor_35_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_108" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Sweeney had attempted
to turn a lease for improvements in Toner's behalf to possession
for himself, but the Northumberland County Court honored
the Fair Play rule concerning military service and decided in favor
of Toner.</p>

<p>The summary process of ejectment utilized by the Fair Play men,
occasionally with militia support, is evident from William King's
deposition in the Huff-Latcha case. King, having sold his right to one
William Paul, recounts the method as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William Paul went on the land and finished his cabin.
Soon after a party b[r]ought Robert Arthur and built a cabin
near Paul's in which Arthur lived. Paul applied to the Fair-play
men who decided in favor of Paul. Arthur would not
go off. Paul made a complaint to the company at a muster at
Quinashahague<a name="FNanchor_36_109" id="FNanchor_36_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_109" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that Arthur still lived on the land and
would not go off, although the Fair-play men had decided
against him. I was one of the officers at that time and we
agreed to come and run him off. The most of the company
came down as far as Edmund Huff's who kept Stills. We got
a keg of whisk[e]y and proceeded to Arthur's cabin. He was
at home with his rifle in his hand and his wife had a bayonet
on a stick, and they threatened death to the first person who
would enter the house. The door was shut and Thomas Kemplen,
our captain, made a run at the door, burst it open and
instantly seized Arthur by the neck. We pulled down the
cabin, threw it into the river, lashed two canoes together
and put Arthur and his family and his goods into them and
sent them down the river. William Paul then lived undisturbed
upon the land until the Indians drove us all away.<a name="FNanchor_37_110" id="FNanchor_37_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_110" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
William Paul was then (1778) from home on a militia tour.<a name="FNanchor_38_111" id="FNanchor_38_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_111" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p><p>Although land disputes offer documentary evidence of the Fair
Play system, it seems quite likely that the tribunal's jurisdiction
extended to other matters. A few anecdotes, obviously based quite
tenuously upon hearsay, will suffice to illustrate. Joseph Antes, son
of Colonel Henry Antes, used to tell this story: It seems that one
Francis Clark, who lived just west of Jersey Shore in the Fair Play
territory, gained possession of a dog which belonged to an Indian.
Upon learning of this, the Indian appealed to the Fair Play men,
who ordered Clark's arrest and trial for the alleged theft. Clark was
convicted and sentenced to be lashed. The punishment was to be
inflicted by a person decided by lot, the responsibility falling upon
the man drawing the red grain of corn from a bag containing grains
of corn for each man present. Philip Antes was the reluctant "winner."
The Indian, seeing that the decision of the "court" was to be
carried out immediately, magnanimously suggested that banishment
would serve better than flogging. Clark agreed and left for the
Nippenose Valley, where his settlement is a matter of record.<a name="FNanchor_39_112" id="FNanchor_39_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_112" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Another anecdote, if true, gives further testimony to the justice of
Fair Play. In this instance, a minister and school teacher named Kincaid
faced the Fair Play tribunal on the charge of abusing his family.
Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to be ridden on a rail for his
offense.<a name="FNanchor_40_113" id="FNanchor_40_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_113" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Here again, the tale, though legendary, is made plausible
by the established fact of Kincaid's residence in the area.<a name="FNanchor_41_114" id="FNanchor_41_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_114" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless the most notable political action of the Fair Play settlers
is their declaration of independence, which Meginness calls "a remarkable
coincidence" because "it took place about the same time
that the Declaration was signed in Philadelphia!"<a name="FNanchor_42_115" id="FNanchor_42_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_115" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Aware, as were
many of the American colonists in the spring and summer of 1776,
that independence was being debated in Philadelphia, these West
Branch pioneers decided to absolve themselves from all allegiance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the Crown and declare their own independence. Meeting under a
large elm on the west bank of Pine Creek, mistakenly known as the
"Tiadaghton Elm," the Fair Play men and settlers simply resolved
their own right of self-determination, a principle upon which they
had been acting for some time. Unfortunately, no record of the resolution
has been preserved&mdash;if it was actually written. However, the
names of the supposed signers, all bona fide Fair Play settlers, have
been passed down to the present.<a name="FNanchor_43_116" id="FNanchor_43_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_116" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>As every careful historian knows, no declaration was signed in
Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, except by the clerk and presiding
officer of the Continental Congress. Consequently, the Pine Creek
story arouses justifiable skepticism. However, there does seem to be
some evidence to substantiate this famous act.</p>

<p>First of all, Fithian's <i>Journal</i> gives insight into the possible motivation
for such independent action. In an entry for Thursday, July
27, 1775, he writes of reviewing "the 'Squires Library," noting that
"After some Perusal I fix'd in the Farmer's memorable Letters."<a name="FNanchor_44_117" id="FNanchor_44_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_117" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Fithian was reading John Dickinson's <i>Letters from a Farmer in
Pennsylvania</i>, which he had come across in the library of John Fleming,
his host for a week in the West Branch Valley. Dickinson's dozen
uncompromising epistles in opposition to the Grenville and Townshend
programs both inspired and incited liberty-lovers. Furthermore,
Fleming himself was a leader among the Fair Play settlers, and may
have been aroused to action by the eloquence of Dickinson's expression.
Every idea is an incitement to action and the ideas of <i>Letters
from a Farmer</i>, which made Dickinson the chief American propagandist
prior to Thomas Paine, reached into the frontier of the
West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>The best contemporary evidence in support of the Pine Creek
declaration is found in the widow's pension application of Anna
Jackson Hamilton, daughter-in-law of Alexander Hamilton, who was
one of the early settlers and a prominent leader along the West Branch
of the Susquehanna. Mrs. Hamilton, whose pension application and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
accompanying statement were made in 1858, lived within one mile
of the reputedly historic elm. In her sworn statement she says, "I
remember well the day independence was declared on the plains of
Pine Creek, seeing such numbers flocking there, and Independence
being all the talk, I had a knolege of what was doing."<a name="FNanchor_45_118" id="FNanchor_45_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_118" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Her son
John corroborates this in his statement that "She and an old colored
woman are the only persons now living in the country who remembers
the meeting of the 4th of July, 1776, at Pine Creek. She remembers
it well."<a name="FNanchor_46_119" id="FNanchor_46_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_119" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Mrs. Hamilton was ninety years old at the time of her
declaration, which was made some eighty-two years after the celebrated
event.<a name="FNanchor_47_120" id="FNanchor_47_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_120" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Following the outbreak of the Revolution and the meeting of the
Second Continental Congress, the Fair Play system of the West Branch
Valley was soon augmented by another extra-legal organization, the
Committee of Safety. Ostensibly created for the purpose of raising and
equipping a "suitable force to form Pennsylvania's quota of the
Continental Army," it soon exercised executive authority dually with
the assembly.<a name="FNanchor_48_121" id="FNanchor_48_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_121" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The Council of Safety was instituted as the successor
to the Committee of Safety by a resolution of the Provincial Convention
of 1776, then meeting in Philadelphia to draw up a new constitution
for Pennsylvania. It was continued by an act of the assembly
that same year. It functioned from July 24, 1776, until it was dissolved
on December 6, 1777, by a proclamation of the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Executive Council.<a name="FNanchor_49_122" id="FNanchor_49_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_122" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Locally, however, the township branches continued
to function and were still referred to as "committees."</p>

<p>It appears from the resolutions and actions of the local committee
that the Fair Play men maintained jurisdiction in land questions, but
that all other cases were within the range of the committee's authority.
In fact, a resolution dated February 27, 1776, asserted that "the committee
of Bald Eagle is the most competent judges of the circumstances
of the people of that township."<a name="FNanchor_50_123" id="FNanchor_50_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_123" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This resolution was made
in conjunction with an order from the county committee to prevent
the loss of rye and other grains which were being "carried out of the
township for stilling."<a name="FNanchor_51_124" id="FNanchor_51_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_124" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Although cautioned against "using too
much rigor in their measures," the committee was advised to find
"a medium between seizing of property and supplying the wants of
the poor."<a name="FNanchor_52_125" id="FNanchor_52_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_125" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The county committee even went so far as to recommend
the suppression of such practices as "profaning the Sabbath in an
unchristian and scandalous manner."<a name="FNanchor_53_126" id="FNanchor_53_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_126" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In April of 1777, the county
committee required an oath of allegiance from one William Reed,
who had refused military service for reasons of conscience.<a name="FNanchor_54_127" id="FNanchor_54_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_127" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Although Bald Eagle Township did not, at this time, extend into
Fair Play territory,<a name="FNanchor_55_128" id="FNanchor_55_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_128" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> it is interesting to note that the local committee,
whose three members frequently changed, often included settlers
from that territory or those who were in close association with the
Fair Play men.<a name="FNanchor_56_129" id="FNanchor_56_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_129" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The Revolution apparently gave a certain quasi-legality
to the claims of the "outlaws" of the West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>One further political note is worthy of mention. After Lexington
and Concord and the formation of the various committees of safety,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the civil officers of Bald Eagle Township, that is to say the constable,
supervisor, and overseers, were often chosen from among settlers on
the borders of, or actually in, Fair Play territory.<a name="FNanchor_57_130" id="FNanchor_57_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_130" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The politics of fair play then was nothing more than that&mdash;fair
play. It was a pragmatic system which the necessities of the frontier
experience, more than national or ethnic origin, had developed. The
"codes" of operation represented a consensus, equally, freely, and
fairly arrived at&mdash;a common "law" based upon general agreement and
practical acceptance. There were subsequent appeals to regular courts
of law, but, surprisingly enough, in every instance the fairness of
the judgments was sustained. No Fair Play decision was reversed.
Furthermore, the frequency of elections and the use of the principle
of rotation in office were additional assurances against the usurpation
of power by any small clique or ruling class. Popular sovereignty,
political equality, and popular consultation&mdash;these were the basic elements
of fair play.</p>

Buchanan on Nov. 12, 1858, (Wagner Collection), stating that "Mrs. Hamilton
is one of the most intelligent in our community." Buchanan then wrote an affidavit
in support of Grier's statements to the Commissioner of Pensions, Nov. 27, 1858,
(Wagner Collection). Aside from the declarations of Mrs. Hamilton and her son,
the only other support, and this is hearsay, is found in the account of an alleged

<h3 class="ity"><big>The Farmers' Frontier</big></h3>


<p>The economy of the West Branch Valley was basically agrarian&mdash;a
farmers' frontier. The "new order of Americanism"<a name="FNanchor_1_131" id="FNanchor_1_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_131" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which arose on this frontier was in part due to the cultural background
of its inhabitants, the knowledge and traditional values which
they had brought with them. It was further influenced by the frontier
status of the region itself&mdash;an area of virgin land in the earliest stages
of development. And finally, it was affected by the physical characteristics
of the territory, particularly the mountains which separated
these settlers from the more established settlements. It has been said
that "many of the enduring characteristics of the American creed and
the American national character originated in the way of life of the
colonial farmer."<a name="FNanchor_2_132" id="FNanchor_2_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_132" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The Fair Play territory was typical of this development.</p>

<p>The early pioneer, particularly if he was Scotch-Irish, generally
came into the area from the Cumberland Valley, the "seed-plot and
nursery" of the Scotch-Irish in America, the "original reservoir" of
this leading frontier stock, via the Great Shamokin Path.<a name="FNanchor_3_133" id="FNanchor_3_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_133" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Since there
were no roads, only Indian trails, the frontier traveler customarily
followed the Indian paths which had been cleared along the rivers
and streams. The Great Shamokin Path followed the Susquehanna
from Shamokin (now Sunbury) to the West Branch, then out along
the West Branch to the Allegheny Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_4_134" id="FNanchor_4_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_134" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Loading his wife and
smaller children on a pack horse, his scanty possessions on another
horse, the prospective settler drove a cow or two into the wild frontier
at the rate of about twenty miles a day.<a name="FNanchor_5_135" id="FNanchor_5_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_135" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This meant that a
trip of approximately two days brought him from Fort Augusta to
the Fair Play country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p><p>Indian paths were the primary means of ingress and egress, although
supplemented by the waterways which they paralleled. In
addition to the Great Shamokin Path, there were paths up Lycoming
Creek (the Sheshequin Path), and up Pine Creek, besides the path
which followed Bald Eagle Creek down into the Juniata Valley. These
trails and adjoining water routes were usually traveled on horseback
or in canoes, depending upon the route to be followed. However,
the rivers and streams were more often passages of departure than
courses of entry.</p>

<p>Established roads, that is authorized public constructions, were not
to reach the West Branch region until 1775, although the Northumberland
County Court ordered such construction and reported on it
at the October term in 1772.<a name="FNanchor_6_136" id="FNanchor_6_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_136" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Appointments were made at the August
session of 1775 "to view, and if they saw cause, to lay out a bridle
road from the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek to the town of Sunbury."<a name="FNanchor_7_137" id="FNanchor_7_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_137" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
It was not until ten years later that extensions of this road were
authorized, carrying it into the Nittany Valley and to Bald Eagle's
Nest (near Milesburg, on the Indian path from the Great Island to
Ohio).<a name="FNanchor_8_138" id="FNanchor_8_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_138" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Travel was usually on horseback or on foot. Canoes and flatboats,
or simply rafts, were used on the rivers and creeks where available.
Wagons, however, appeared after the construction of public roads
and were seen in the Great Runaway of 1778.<a name="FNanchor_9_139" id="FNanchor_9_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_139" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The problem of communication between the frontier and the settled
areas was a difficult one compounded by the natural geographic
barriers and the fact that post and coach roads did not extend into
this central Pennsylvania region. As a result the inhabitants had to
depend upon occasional travelers, circuit riders, surveyors, and other
Provincial authorities who visited them infrequently. Otherwise, the
meetings of the Fair Play tribunal, irregular as they were, and the
communications from the county Committee of Safety were about
the only sources of information available. Of course, cabin-building,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
cornhusking, and quilting parties provided ample opportunities for
the dissemination of strictly "local" news.</p>

<p>Newspapers were not introduced into the upper Susquehanna Valley
until around the turn of the century. The <i>Northumberland
Gazette</i> was published in Sunbury in 1797 or 1798.<a name="FNanchor_10_140" id="FNanchor_10_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_140" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The first truly
West Branch paper was not circulated until 1802, when the <i>Lycoming
Gazette</i> was first published in Williamsport.<a name="FNanchor_11_141" id="FNanchor_11_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_141" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> On the eve
of the Revolution there were only seven newspapers available in the
entire Province, none of which circulated as far north as the Fair
Play territory.<a name="FNanchor_12_142" id="FNanchor_12_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_142" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> As a matter of fact, there were only thirty-seven
papers printed in all thirteen colonies at the beginning of the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_13_143" id="FNanchor_13_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_143" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Fair Play settler was an "outlaw," a squatter who came into
this central Pennsylvania wilderness with his family and without the
benefit of a land grant, and who literally hacked and carved out a
living. The natural elements, the savage natives, and the wild life all
resisted him; but he conquered them all, and the conquest gave him
a feeling of accomplishment which enhanced his independent spirit.</p>

<p>If the story of the Great Plains frontier can be told in terms of railroads,
barbed-wire fences, windmills, and six-shooters,<a name="FNanchor_14_144" id="FNanchor_14_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_144" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> then the
cruder tale of the West Branch frontier can be told in terms of the
rifle, the axe, and the plow. The rifle, first and foremost as the
weapon of security, was the basic means of self-preservation in a wild
land where survival was a constant question.<a name="FNanchor_15_145" id="FNanchor_15_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_145" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The axe, which Theodore
Roosevelt later described as "a servant hardly standing second
even to the rifle,"<a name="FNanchor_16_146" id="FNanchor_16_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_146" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was the main implement of destruction and construction.
It was used for clearing the forest of the many trees which
encroached upon the acreage which the settler had staked out for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
himself, and for cutting the logs which would provide the rude, one-room
shelter the pioneer constructed for himself and his family. The
crude wooden plow was the implement which made this frontiersman
a farmer, although its effectiveness was extremely limited. However,
the soil was so fertile, and the weeds so sparse, that scratching the
earth and scattering seeds produced a crop.<a name="FNanchor_17_147" id="FNanchor_17_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_147" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A contemporary description of squatter settlements in Muncy Hills,
some twenty-odd miles east of the Fair Play territory, but in the
West Branch Valley, gives a vivid picture of the nature of these early
establishments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They came from no Body enquires where, or how, but generally
with Families, fix on any Spot in the Wood that
pleases them. Cut down some trees &amp; make up a Log Hut in a
Day, clear away the underweed &amp; girdle.... The Trees they
have no use for if cut down after their Hut is made. They
dig up &amp; harrow the Ground, plant Potatoes, a Crop which
they get out in three Months, sow Corn, etc., (&amp; having
sown in peace by the Law of the Land they are secured in
reaping in peace) &amp; continue at Work without ever enquiring
whose the Land is, until the Proprietor himself disturbs
&amp; drives them off with Difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_18_148" id="FNanchor_18_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_148" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>This experience was duplicated in the Fair Play territory where
there were no immediate neighbors whose permission was necessary
for settlement, or until a dispute was carried to the tribunal for
adjudication. This procedure was detailed in the last chapter.</p>

<p>Having selected a site, preferably on or near a stream, and obtained
approval from the Fair Play men and his neighbors, the prospective
settler was faced with the long and tedious work of clearing
the land for his home and farm. This was an extended effort for he
could clear only a few acres a year. In the meantime, his survival
depended upon the few provisions he brought with him&mdash;some grain
for meal, a little flour, and perhaps some salt pork and smoked meat.
These supplies, combined with the wild game and fish which abounded
in the area, served until such a time as crops could be produced. It
was a rigorous life complicated by the fact that the meager supplies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
often ran out before the first crop was brought in. The first month's
meals were too often variations on the limited fare of water porridge
and hulled corn, as described by a later pioneer.<a name="FNanchor_19_149" id="FNanchor_19_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_149" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Homes in the Fair Play territory were built "to <i>live</i> in, and not
for <i>show</i>...."<a name="FNanchor_20_150" id="FNanchor_20_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_150" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The following description, by the grandson of one
of the original settlers, illustrates the cooperative nature of the enterprise,
in addition to giving a clear picture of the type of construction
which replaced the early lean-to shelter with which the
frontiersman was first acquainted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our buildings are made of hewn logs, on an average 24
feet long by 20 wide, sometimes a wall of stone, a foot or
more above the level of the earth, raised as a foundation;
but in general, four large stones are laid at the corners, and
the building raised on <i>them</i>. The house is covered sometimes
with shingles, sometimes with clapboards. [The latter required
no laths, rafters, or nails, and was put on in less
time.] ... The ground logs being laid saddle-shaped, on
the upper edge, is cut in with an axe, at the ends, as long as
the logs are thick, then the end logs are raised and a "notch"
cut to fit the saddle. This is the only kind of tie or binder
they have; and when the building is raised as many rounds
as it is intended, the ribs are raised, on which a course of
clapboards is laid, butts resting on a "butting pole." A press
pole is laid on the clapboards immediately over the ribs to
keep them from shifting by the wind, and the pole is kept to
its berth by stay blocks, resting in the first course against the
butting-pole. The logs are run upon the building on skids
by the help of wooden forks. The most experienced "axe-man"
are placed on the buildings as "cornermen;" the rest of
the company are on the ground to carry the logs and run
them up.<a name="FNanchor_21_151" id="FNanchor_21_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_151" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>In this fashion, the frontier cabin was raised and covered in a single
day, without a mason, without a pound of iron, and with nothing
but dirt for flooring. The doors and windows were subsequently cut
out of the structure to suit the tastes of its occupants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>In this one-room cabin lived the frontier settler and his family, who
might be joined by guests. Small wonder, then, that additions to
this construction took on such significance that they were items of
mention in later wills.<a name="FNanchor_22_152" id="FNanchor_22_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_152" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Once having cleared a reasonable portion of his property, raised
his cabin, and scratched out an existence for his first few months of
occupation, the pioneer was now ready to get down to the business of
farming. Working around the stumps which cluttered his improvement,
the frontier farmer planted his main crops, which were, of
course, the food grains&mdash;wheat, rye, with oats, barley, and corn, and
buckwheat and corn for the livestock. Some indication of the planting
and harvesting seasons can be seen from this account:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I find Wheat is sown here in the Fall (beging. of Septr.)
Clover &amp; timothy Grass is generally sown with it. The Wheat
is cut in June or beginning of July after which the Grass
grows very rapidly &amp; always affords two Crops. Where
Grass has not been sown they harrow the Ground well where

<p>The amazing fertility of the soil, as noted by more than one journalist,
eased the difficulties of the crude wooden implements which
were the farmer's tools. Reference is made to "one [who] plowed the
same spot ... for eight years ... [taking] double Crops without giving
it an Ounce of Manure."<a name="FNanchor_24_154" id="FNanchor_24_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_154" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Scientific farming had not yet come to the
West Branch Valley, although the Philadelphia area had been
awakened to its possibilities through the publications of Franklin's
American Philosophical Society.</p>

<p>Fertile soil was practically essential when one considers the crude
implements with which the frontier farmer carried on his hazardous
vocation. In addition to the crude wooden plow, which we have already
mentioned, the agrarian pioneer of the West Branch possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a long-bladed sickle, a homemade rake, a homemade hay fork, and a
grain shovel.<a name="FNanchor_25_155" id="FNanchor_25_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_155" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> All of these items were made of wood and were of
the crudest sort.<a name="FNanchor_26_156" id="FNanchor_26_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_156" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As time went on, he added a few tools of his own
invention, but these, and his sturdy curved-handled axe, constituted
the essential instruments of the farmer's craft.</p>

<p>July was the month of harvest for the mainly "subsistence" farmers
scattered along the West Branch. The uncertainties of the weather
and the number of acres planted had some influence upon the harvesting,
so that it was not unusual to see the wheat still swaying in
the warm summer breezes in the last week of July. However, if possible,
the grain was generally cut the first part of the month in order
that buckwheat, or other fodder, might be sown and harvested in
the fall.</p>

<p>Harvesttime was a cooperative enterprise and whole families joined
in "bringing in the sheaves." The grain had to be cut and raked
into piles, and the piles bundled into shocks tied together with stalks
of the grain itself. This took "hands" and the frontier family was
generally the only labor force available. In time, however, field work
was confined to the men of the family among the Scotch-Irish, who
attached social significance to the type of work done by their women.</p>

<p>Fithian's <i>Journal</i> reveals, however, that class-consciousness was not
yet apparent in the division of labor on this frontier. On two occasions
he describes daughters of leading families engaged in other than
household tasks. Arriving at the home of Squire Fleming, with
whom he was to stay for a week, Fithian notes on July 25, 1775, that
Betsey Fleming, his host's daughter, "was milking."<a name="FNanchor_27_157" id="FNanchor_27_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_157" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The very next
day, upon visiting the Squire's brother, who had "two fine Daughter's,"
this Presbyterian journalist found "One of them reaping."<a name="FNanchor_28_158" id="FNanchor_28_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_158" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> If
Leyburn's comment that social status among the Scotch-Irish depended
in part upon the work done by the women of the family, then these
examples attest to the fact that "status" was a luxury which the Fair
Play settlers could not yet afford.<a name="FNanchor_29_159" id="FNanchor_29_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_159" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p><p>Threshing was either done by hand with flails, or, if the family had
a cow or two (and the tax lists indicate that they did), the grain was
separated by driving the livestock around and around over the unbundled
straw. Finally, the chaff was removed by throwing the grain
into the air while the breeze was flowing. The grain was then collected
and readied for milling.</p>

<p>Gristmills were available in the West Branch Valley almost from
the outset of settlement due to the many fine streams which flowed
through the territory. As a result, few farmers had to travel more
than five miles, generally on horseback, to carry their bags of grain to
the mill. If the farmer had no horse, he had to carry his sack of
grain on his shoulder. If the settler lived on or near a stream, he
put his sacks of grain in a canoe and paddled downstream to the
nearest mill. In the early days before the mills, the grain was pounded
into meal by using a heavy pestle and a hollowed-out stump, a crude
mortar which served the purpose.</p>

<p>In time, the gristmill owners also operated distilleries, converting
the pioneer's wheat, rye, and barley into spirited beverages which
were freely imbibed along this and other frontiers. By the time of
the Revolution, distilling was so common as to cause the Committee
of Safety to take action to conserve the grain.<a name="FNanchor_30_160" id="FNanchor_30_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_160" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> "Home brew," however,
was quite the custom, and it was not long before most farmers
operated their own stills.</p>

<p>Self-sufficiency was both a characteristic and a necessity among these
Scotch-Irish, English, and German settlers of central Pennsylvania.
Bringing their agrarian traditions with them from the "old country,"
where they had operated small farms, they were bound to a "subsistence
farming" existence by the inaccessibility of markets to the
frontier. One diarist found this conducive to a "perfect Independence"
which made a "Market to them, almost unnecessary."<a name="FNanchor_31_161" id="FNanchor_31_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_161" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This
economic independence carried over into frontier manufacturing, if
it can be called that, because the industry, except for the gristmills
and their distilleries, was strictly domestic.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>It has often been said that the frontier farmer was a "jack-of-all
trades," and the West Branch settler of the Fair Play territory was
a typical example. With no market of skilled labor, or any other
market for that matter,<a name="FNanchor_32_162" id="FNanchor_32_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_162" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> he was his own carpenter, cooper, shoe-maker,
tailor, and blacksmith. Whatever he wanted or needed had to
be made in his own home. Thus, frontier industry was of the
handicraft or domestic type, with tasks apportioned among the various
members of the family in accordance with their sex and talent.
It was truly a "complete little world" in which the pioneer family
supplied its every demand by its own efforts.<a name="FNanchor_33_163" id="FNanchor_33_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_163" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Although the role of the women was to take on status significance
as the frontier areas became more stable, in the earlier years of settlement
their tasks were extensive and varied. Though they were busy
with household duties such as churning butter, making soap, pouring
candles, quilting, and weaving cloth for the family's clothing, it
was not uncommon for the women to join the men in the field at
harvesttime. The domesticity of the American housewife may be
one impact on American life made by the Germans.<a name="FNanchor_34_164" id="FNanchor_34_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_164" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The children, too, were important persons in the economic life of
the frontier family. Their labors lightened the load for both father
and mother. With no available labor market from which to draw
farm hands and household help, it was both necessary and useful to
give the boys and girls a vocational apprenticeship in farming or
homemaking. The girls' responsibilities were usually, although not
exclusively, related to the hearth; the efforts of the boys were generally
confined to the field and the implements employed there, although
they did service too as household handymen, hauling wood, making
fires, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_35_165" id="FNanchor_35_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_165" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>In addition to their farming and domestic industry, the other economic
activities of these agrarian pioneers included the care of their
livestock and the exploitation of the available natural resources in
their subsistence pattern of living. The tax lists for Northumberland
County indicate the possession of two or three horses and a like number
of cows for each head of a household.<a name="FNanchor_36_166" id="FNanchor_36_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_166" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> There were also "various
Breeds of Hogs" although they were not listed by the tax
assessor.<a name="FNanchor_37_167" id="FNanchor_37_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_167" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Mr. Davy's comment that "Sheep are not well understood
... often destroyed by the Wolves ... few ... except [those] of good
Capital keep them" may explain their absence from these same assessments.<a name="FNanchor_38_168" id="FNanchor_38_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_168" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Maple syrup provided the sugar supply, a fact noted by land speculators
who touted this "Country Abounding in the Sugar Tree."<a name="FNanchor_39_169" id="FNanchor_39_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_169" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Anti-slave interests later thought that maple sugar would replace the
slave-produced cane sugar.<a name="FNanchor_40_170" id="FNanchor_40_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_170" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Mr. Davy described the process as he
observed it at Muncy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Maple Trees yield about 5 w of Sugar each on an
average annually, some give as much as 15 ws but these are
rare. It is drawn off in April &amp; May by boring holes in the
Tree into which Quills &amp; Canes are introduced to convey
the Juice to a Trough placed round the bottom of it. This
juice is boiled down to Sugar &amp; clarified with very little
trouble &amp; is very good.<a name="FNanchor_41_171" id="FNanchor_41_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_171" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></div>

<p>Honey also existed in great quantities in the area and was used
extensively. Apparently the "sweet tooth" of the West Branch settlers
was well satisfied by the ample resources for saccharine products.</p>

<p>The trade and commerce of the West Branch Valley were strictly
confined to its own locale. Mountain barriers, limited transportation
facilities, and insufficient contact with the settled areas of the Province
only served to heighten the essential self-sufficiency of the Fair Play
settlers. The result was an economic independence which doubtless
had its political manifestations.<a name="FNanchor_42_172" id="FNanchor_42_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_172" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>Economic conditions have their political implications, but it was
the total impact of the frontier and not simply the commercial
restrictions of some outside authority which made the Fair Play settlers
self-reliant and independent "subsistence" farmers. The farmers'
frontier did not result from the impact of any particular national
stock groups, for Scotch-Irish, English, and German settlers reacted
similarly. As the most recent historian of the Scotch-Irish, the most
numerical national stock on this frontier, suggests, "authentically
democratic principles, when the Scotch-Irish exhibited them in America,
were rather the result of their experiences on colonial frontiers
than the product of the Scottish and Ulster heritage."<a name="FNanchor_43_173" id="FNanchor_43_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_173" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The farmers'
frontier with its characteristics of individualistic self-reliance was
a product of the frontier itself.</p>

about its significance which can hardly be substantiated. <i>See</i> Morris K.
Turner, <i>The Commercial Relations of the Susquehanna Valley During the Colonial
Period</i> (Ph.D. Thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1916). This dissertation, although
claiming to deal with the Susquehanna Valley, never gets much beyond Harrisburg
and seldom reaches as far north as Fort Augusta. Its accounts of roads, navigation
improvements, and trade fail to reach the Fair Play settlers. This lends further
support to their independent and self-sufficient existence. Turner's concluding
paragraph is, however, a gem of economic determinism and bears repeating in full.
Found on page 100, it reads as follows:
</p><p>
"If then, the commercial relations of the Susquehanna Valley were so far reaching
affecting as they did in the pre-Revolutionary period the attitude of the people on
all the questions, practically, of the day it is only fair to say that it was these
relations which promoted the Revolution in the Province and drove the old government
out of existence. The political issues were aided and abetted, yes, were created,
were born from the womb of the neglected commercial relations of the Province
and no other section at the time had such extensive relations as the Susquehanna
Valley. No other conclusion can be reached after a serious study of the history
of the period."</p></div>

<h3 class="ity"><big>Fair Play Society</big></h3>


<p>The society of the Fair Play territory, between the year 1769
and 1784, was indeed simple. There were no towns or population
clusters, either in the territory or within a range of some
thirty-five or forty miles. Furthermore, as we have already noted,
transportation and communication facilities were so limited as to make
contact with the "outside world" an exception rather than the rule.
As we have also seen, economic functions on this farmers' frontier were
not highly specialized. Even the political system, with its tribunal
of Fair Play men, operated without the benefit of any formal code.</p>

<p>But it would be easy, from these indications, to magnify the simplicity
of the social structure and of social relationships in the West
Branch Valley. If we are to consider the development of democracy
on this frontier, we must take into account the various national stock
groups who settled this area and, in so doing, weigh their relative
economic and social status, the amount of intermarriage between
them, and the ease and frequency with which they visited each other.
These and other social relationships, such as their joint participation
in voluntary associations, their prejudices and conflicts, and the assimilation
of alien groups, must all be evaluated. The leadership, the
existence of social classes, and the family patterns must, of necessity,
be a part of our inquiry. And finally, the religious institutions, the
educational and cultural opportunities, and the system of values have
to be considered in arriving at a judgment regarding the democratic
nature of Fair Play society.</p>

<p>Fair Play society was composed of Scotch-Irish (48.75 per cent),
English (20 per cent), German (15 per cent), Scots (6.25 per cent),
Irish (5 per cent), Welsh (2.5 per cent) and French (2.5 per cent)
settlers.<a name="FNanchor_1_174" id="FNanchor_1_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_174" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Due to the pioneering conditions under which all of these
national stock groups developed their "improvements," economic
privilege was rather difficult to attain. Furthermore, even after the
legislature granted pre-emption in the act of December, 1784, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
grants were limited to 300 acres.<a name="FNanchor_2_175" id="FNanchor_2_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_175" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In consequence of this, massive holdings
were impossible to maintain legally, as the customary holdings of
two to three hundred acres indicate in the tax lists for the years after
1784.<a name="FNanchor_3_176" id="FNanchor_3_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_176" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In fact, the tax lists suggest that absentee-owners or persons
outside the actual geographic limits of the Fair Play territory who
participated with the Fair Play settlers were the only ones to possess
700 to 1,000 acres or more.<a name="FNanchor_4_177" id="FNanchor_4_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_177" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This fact, combined with the "subsistence
farming" which all of the area settlers pursued, suggests a relatively
comparable economic status for the members of the Fair Play society.
Consequently, social status was not necessarily dependent upon economic
status.</p>

<p>Social status on this frontier depended more upon achieved status
than ascribed status. This may have been an influence of the Scotch-Irish,
who judged, and thus classified, a neighbor by the size and
condition of his dwelling, the care of his farm, the work done by the
women in the family, his personal characteristics and morality, and his
diversions.<a name="FNanchor_5_178" id="FNanchor_5_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_178" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Journalists, pension claimants, and the operative, although
unwritten, code of the Fair Play men all give corroborative evidence
in this regard.<a name="FNanchor_6_179" id="FNanchor_6_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_179" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of all these criteria, personal character and morality
seemed to have been most important. The Scotch-Irish, who, like the
people of other national stocks, accepted social classes as the right
ordering of society, shifted their emphasis, as a result of the frontier
experience, from family heritage to individual achievement.<a name="FNanchor_7_180" id="FNanchor_7_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_180" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p><p>Intermarriages provide a further key to the social relationships of
the Fair Play settlers. If a small sample is any indication, the cases
of intermarriages among the various national stock groups were
relatively high, with better than one-third of the marriages sampled
falling within this classification.<a name="FNanchor_8_181" id="FNanchor_8_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_181" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The fact that the Scotch-Irish frequently
married within their own group was probably due to their
being more "available" in terms of numbers. Industry and good character
were the prime criteria for selecting a frontier mate, as Dunaway
points out.<a name="FNanchor_9_182" id="FNanchor_9_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_182" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The ease and frequency of neighborly visits is vividly demonstrated
in the characteristically cooperative cabin-raisings, barn-raisings, cornhuskings
and similar activities in which joint effort was usual. The
women, too, exchanged visits and, on occasion, gathered at one place
for quilting or other mutually shared activities.<a name="FNanchor_10_183" id="FNanchor_10_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_183" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Furthermore, the
frontier journalists often noted the fine hospitality and congeniality
of their backwoods hosts.<a name="FNanchor_11_184" id="FNanchor_11_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_184" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of the egalitarian influence of this frontier is
found in the joint participation of Fair Play settlers in voluntary associations.<a name="FNanchor_12_185" id="FNanchor_12_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_185" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
This is particularly noticeable in their attendance at
outdoor sermons and involvement in the various political activities.
At a time when fewer than 100 families lived in the territory, Fithian
observed that "There were present about an Hundred &amp; forty" people
for a sermon which he gave on the banks of the Susquehanna, opposite
the present city of Lock Haven, on Sunday, July 30, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_13_186" id="FNanchor_13_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_186" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Although William Colbert, a Methodist, later "preached to a large
congregation of willing hearers" within the territory, he did not think
that it was "worth the preachers while to stop here."<a name="FNanchor_14_187" id="FNanchor_14_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_187" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This may
have been due to the fact that they were mainly Presbyterians. Colbert's
reception was apparently fair for he makes a point of saying,
"I know not that there is a prejudiced person among them."<a name="FNanchor_15_188" id="FNanchor_15_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_188" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> No
regular church was established in this region until 1792, so it appears
that the settlers generally participated in group religious activities
regardless of the denominational affiliation of the preacher conducting
the services. However, as we will point out later, this is not to
suggest that there was no friction between denominations.</p>

<p>The political activities of the Fair Play settlers demonstrate the
mass participation, at least of the adult males, in this type of voluntary
association. The annual elections of the Fair Play men were
conducted without discrimination against any of the settlers by reason
of religion, national origin, or property. In addition, the decisions
of the tribunal were carried out, as Smith reports, "by the
whole body, who started up in mass, at the mandate of the court."<a name="FNanchor_16_189" id="FNanchor_16_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_189" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Special occasions, such as the Pine Creek Declaration of Independence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
were also marked by the participation <i>en masse</i> of these West Branch
pioneers. Mrs. Hamilton, in her widow's pension application, speaks
of "seeing such numbers flocking there" (along the banks of Pine
Creek in July of 1776).<a name="FNanchor_17_190" id="FNanchor_17_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_190" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Apparently, as Mrs. Hamilton says, most of
the settlers "had a knolege of what was doing," particularly with
regard to political affairs.<a name="FNanchor_18_191" id="FNanchor_18_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_191" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>These evidences of group participation in religious and political
activities should not mislead one into thinking that conflict, legal or
otherwise, was alien to the West Branch frontiersmen. The cases
brought before the Fair Play "court" and the friction between Methodists
and Presbyterians affirm this strife. The first settler in the territory,
Cleary Campbell, was an almost constant litigant, both as
plaintiff and defendant, in the Northumberland County Court from
the time of his arrival in 1769.<a name="FNanchor_19_192" id="FNanchor_19_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_192" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> His name, along with the names
of other Fair Play settlers, appeared regularly on the Appearance
Dockets of the Northumberland and Lycoming County courts. The
cases usually involved land titles and personal obligations or debts.</p>

<p>The religious conflict is clearly seen in the journal of the Reverend
William Colbert. An incident which occurred about twenty miles
south of the West Branch illustrates this friction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a town [present-day Milton] with three stores,
three taverns, two ball allies. Agreeable to its size it appears
to be one of the most dissipated places I ever saw. I could
not tell how to pass them&mdash;I inquired at one of the ball allies
if preaching was expected&mdash;A religious old Presbyterian
standing by where they were playing answered that he did
not know. I then asked them that were playing ball, they answered
no. I farther asked them if they did not think they
would be better employed hearing preaching than playing
ball. Their answer was a laugh, that there was time for all
things and that they went to preachings on Sundays. I told
them they would not be willing to go to judgment from that
exercise&mdash;they said they ventured that. So after a little conversation
with the old man I left them ripening for destruction....<a name="FNanchor_20_193" id="FNanchor_20_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_193" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Colbert's journal is filled with snide remarks and caustic comments
about Presbyterians in general and Calvinist doctrines in particular.<a name="FNanchor_21_194" id="FNanchor_21_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_194" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
He was especially concerned for the "lost souls" of the Presbyterians
of the West Branch Valley. A twentieth-century theologian suggests
that Presbyterian dogmatism had driven the Scotch-Irish to the frontier;
this same problem complicated their social relationships in the
backwoods country.<a name="FNanchor_22_195" id="FNanchor_22_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_195" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The process of acculturation of the frontier was marked by the impact
of the aborigines upon the new white settlers in terms of the
developing style of life in the West Branch Valley. In fact, the culture
of the Indian may have affected the white settlers more than
theirs affected that of the Indian. For instance, Mr. Davy says that
"the Dress &amp; manners of the People more nearly assimilate to those
of the Indians than lower down, but the purest English Language is
universally spoken."<a name="FNanchor_23_196" id="FNanchor_23_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_196" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The West Branch Valley was a new world whose experiences made
new men, rather than a transplanted old world with its emphasis on
heritage and tradition.<a name="FNanchor_24_197" id="FNanchor_24_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_197" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> However, the English language and Scots
Presbyterianism were basic ingredients in the melting pot of this and
other frontiers where the American character emerged.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>The social class structure of Fair Play society is rather difficult to
assess. Extensive land holdings and material possessions were not
characteristic of these "squatter" settlements. Consequently, property
was not the distinguishing factor in stratifying the social levels of the
Fair Play community. Furthermore, there was no slave population
or indentured servant class to be confined to the lowest rung of the
social ladder. Here, each man either owned his "improvement" or operated
under some condition of tenancy. However, both indentured
servitude and Negro slavery existed in the "New Purchase" of 1768
in nearby Muncy.<a name="FNanchor_25_198" id="FNanchor_25_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_198" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Thus, it was a two-class pattern, in the main, which
constituted the Fair Play society&mdash;landholders and tenants. In addition,
though, there was a further delineation within the landholding
class on the basis of character and morality. This characteristically
Scotch-Irish differentiation may have been due to the predominance
of the Ulsterites in the West Branch population.<a name="FNanchor_26_199" id="FNanchor_26_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_199" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In consideration
of this fact, a three-class structure, consisting of an elite, other landholders,
and tenants, would best describe the social class system of the
Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>The elite of the Fair Play society were generally the political and
economic leaders as well. They owned the "forts," operated the gristmills,
and held the prominent political positions in the vicinity. Surprisingly
enough, though, they frequently resided on the fringe areas
of the territory and were thus able to acquire more land.<a name="FNanchor_27_200" id="FNanchor_27_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_200" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A fuller
description of this elite and its leadership is given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The frontier family was undoubtedly the key social institution in
transmitting this new "American" culture to subsequent generations.
Regardless of national origin, the families were closely-knit, well-disciplined
units, whose members formed rather complete social and
economic entities. As we have already noted, the agrarian family had
its own division of labor, with each member carrying out his assigned
tasks and, at the same time, learning the practices and procedures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the farmers' frontier. It was also the cultural and educational
core, in which its members learned their faith, received their education,
and acquired the values which would serve them throughout
their lives. Family loyalty was a marked characteristic on the frontier
and, incidentally, among the Scotch-Irish. The woman's lot was
severe but she accepted it with a submissiveness which can still be
seen in some backcountry areas of Pennsylvania today.<a name="FNanchor_28_201" id="FNanchor_28_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_201" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Clannish
and dependent upon each other, the frontier family had no use for
divorce, which was practically unknown.<a name="FNanchor_29_202" id="FNanchor_29_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_202" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> If the patterns and values
of these frontier families tended to approximate those of the Scotch-Irish
in particular, and they did, it was because the Scotch-Irish were
representative rather than unique.<a name="FNanchor_30_203" id="FNanchor_30_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_203" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The church was probably the second most important social institution
in developing a system of values and a "style of life" in the
Fair Play territory. Here again, the Scotch-Irish with their Presbyterianism
provided the most significant influence, and ultimately the
first regular church&mdash;although Methodists, such as Colbert, found little
to favor in Calvinism. Almost without exception, the wills probated
in the courts of Northumberland and Lycoming counties
between 1772 and 1830 asked for burial "in a decent and Christian
like manner," and committed the departed soul to "the Creator." A
Christian life and a Christian burial were valued in this frontier society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Due to the absence of regular churches, religious instruction was
primarily carried on by mothers "abel to instruct," as Mrs. Hamilton
put it.<a name="FNanchor_31_204" id="FNanchor_31_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_204" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Prayer, the reading of the Bible, and a rudimentary catechism
were all a part of this home worship, conducted by one or both
parents. Baptism and other sacraments of the church were provided by
itinerant pastors who made their "rounds" through the valley. Presbyterians
and, later, Methodists developed the practice of gathering
together in their cabins in "praying societies."<a name="FNanchor_32_205" id="FNanchor_32_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_205" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Originally consisting
of neighbor groups, these societies, in time, took in areas consisting of
several miles.<a name="FNanchor_33_206" id="FNanchor_33_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_206" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Itinerant pastors began to include the Fair Play territory in their
travels in the decade of the 1770's. Philip Vickers Fithian learned
from his host, Squire Fleming, that he was the first "orderly" preacher
in the area.<a name="FNanchor_34_207" id="FNanchor_34_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_207" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Fithian's visit came about after he obtained an honorable
dismissal from the first Philadelphia Presbytery&mdash;as no vacancies
existed&mdash;in order to preach outside its bounds.<a name="FNanchor_35_208" id="FNanchor_35_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_208" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Although in the territory
for only one week in the summer of 1775, Fithian's account of
his Sunday sermon on the banks of the Susquehanna clearly describes
the nature of wilderness preaching:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At eleven I began Service. We crossed over to the Indian
Land, &amp; held Worship on the Bank of the River, opposite to
the Great Island, about a Mile &amp; a half below 'Squire Fleming's.
There were present about an Hundred &amp; forty; I stood
at the Root of a great Tree, &amp; the People sitting in the Bushes,
&amp; green Grass round me.</p>

<p>They gave great Attention. I had the Eyes of all upon me.
I spoke with some Force, &amp; pretty loud. I recommended to
them earnestly the religious Observation of God's Sabbaths,
in this remote Place, where they seldom have the Gospel
preached&mdash;that they should attend with Carefulness &amp; Reverence
upon it when it is among them&mdash;And that they ought
to strive to have it established here.<a name="FNanchor_36_209" id="FNanchor_36_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_209" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><p>Fithian's recommendation was not carried out until 1792, when the
Pine Creek Church was organized under the historic "independence"
elm with Robert Love and a Mr. Culbertson as the first elders.<a name="FNanchor_37_210" id="FNanchor_37_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_210" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This
church, along with the Lycoming Church, which was formed in the
eastern part of the former Fair Play territory in October of that same
year, was served by the Reverend Isaac Grier, who was called to serve
Lycoming Creek, Pine Creek, and the Great Island, and ordained and
installed by the Carlisle Presbytery, April 9, 1794.<a name="FNanchor_38_211" id="FNanchor_38_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_211" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He thus became
the first regularly installed pastor in what had been the Fair Play
territory.</p>

<p>It was not until 1811 that the Presbyterian General Assembly organized
the Northumberland Presbytery, which serves West Branch
Valley Presbyterians to this day. In the days of the Fair Play system
the area was assigned to Donegal Presbytery, although in 1786 the
Carlisle Presbytery was formed out of the western part of Donegal.<a name="FNanchor_39_212" id="FNanchor_39_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_212" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Missionary efforts of Presbyterians in the Fair Play territory go all
the way back to September of 1746, when the Reverend David Brainerd
preached to the Indians of the Great Island.<a name="FNanchor_40_213" id="FNanchor_40_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_213" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But from that time
until the opening of the West Branch Valley to settlement, following
the first treaty at Fort Stanwix, nothing concerning the area appears
on presbytery records. However, after the treaty one Presbyterian
minister, the Reverend Francis Alison, pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Philadelphia and vice-provost of the College of Philadelphia,
applied for land above the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek and was
granted some 1,500 acres.<a name="FNanchor_41_214" id="FNanchor_41_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_214" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Alison never came into the region and, in
fact, sold his entire purchase to John Fleming in 1773.<a name="FNanchor_42_215" id="FNanchor_42_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_215" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Although Fithian was the first "orderly" preacher assigned to the
West Branch, the Donegal Presbytery had received an application
from "setlers upon the W. Branch of Susquehannah" for ministerial
supplies (pastors) in the middle of April, 1772.<a name="FNanchor_43_216" id="FNanchor_43_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_216" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Apparently these
supplies never reached north of present-day Lewisburg.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>Presbyterianism, then, was the most significant religious influence
in the Fair Play territory. Methodists and Baptists penetrated the region
after the Revolution, but that penetration, although marked by
some conflict, was not vital to the development of a system of values
on this frontier during the period under study.<a name="FNanchor_44_217" id="FNanchor_44_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_217" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Furthermore, it was
not until well into the nineteenth century that other Protestant sects
established churches in the West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>The extent of that influence and the nature of this frontier faith
were central to the development of Fair Play society. Since there were
no organized churches in the area, the family was the key agency of
religious instruction and service. This fact, combined with the impact
of the Great Awakening, led to the freeing of the individual from the
communal covenant, resulting in a secularization of religion which
culminated in a kind of "predestined freedom."<a name="FNanchor_45_218" id="FNanchor_45_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_218" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Consequently, the
political implications of American Presbyterianism, which had the
largest church membership in colonial Pennsylvania and the strongest
affiliation on this frontier, were demonstrated in the democratic radicalism
which the frontier spawned. Political maturity, that is to say,
independence, was a logical evolution from religious emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_46_219" id="FNanchor_46_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_219" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p><p>In addition to the political implications of Presbyterianism, respect
for education was a significant factor in the value structure of this
frontier. The probate records of this period are filled with examples
of the great desire to see the "children schooled," and specific educational
instructions were often included in the wills.<a name="FNanchor_47_220" id="FNanchor_47_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_220" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The Presbyterian
emphasis upon an educated ministry suggests that this
reverence for education may also have been an education for reverence.
Morality, education, and political equality and freedom&mdash;these
were the basic tenets of this frontier faith.</p>

<p>Despite the high value placed upon education, the educational
and cultural opportunities on this frontier, as on others, were extremely
limited. Aside from home instruction and the occasional
visit of an itinerant pastor, formal education was a luxury which
these pioneers could not yet afford. However, earlier historians of
the West Branch refer to the existence of a "log school" at "Sour's
ferry" in 1774.<a name="FNanchor_48_221" id="FNanchor_48_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_221" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Instruction in the "three R's," enforced with strict
discipline, was given here a few months out of the year. A Presbyterian
preacher who came into the region and stayed was the first
teacher. Educational opportunity was extremely limited but education
was highly respected.</p>

<p>Books, too, were a luxury in the West Branch Valley. Although
some of the wills of Fair Play settlers indicate the importance of
books by mentioning them specifically, there was no common library
from which the settlers could draw. However, Fithian's <i>Journal</i>
contains a note that he "reviewed the 'Squires Library"; so we do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
know of at least one library in the territory. Its accessibility for
most of these pioneers is, of course, another question.</p>

<p>Frontier art was mainly functional. Its objects were generally the
furniture, the tools and weapons, and the implements of the household.
Individual expressions of creative talent, these items, whether
they were designs on the rifle stock or styles of tableware, were outlets
of artistic demonstration. Probably the most prized and picturesque
of the frontier folk arts was the making of patchwork quilts.<a name="FNanchor_49_222" id="FNanchor_49_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_222" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Although
we have found no "Fair Play" pattern, we do know that the
women of every frontier household sewed, and, because of the demand
for bed quilts, every scrap was saved for the quilt-making. Colbert's
<i>Journal</i> tells of his dining at one Richard Manning's "with a number
of women who were quilting."<a name="FNanchor_50_223" id="FNanchor_50_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_223" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Quilting parties were social events
in the lives of these frontier women, and their <i>objets d'art</i> were fully
discussed from patterns and designs down to the intricate techniques
of needlecraft. Perhaps the patchwork quilt is the enduring legacy of
frontier folk art.</p>

<p>The music of the frontier was primarily vocal&mdash;the singing of hymns
and, possibly, folk songs. Instrumental music was confined to the
fiddle, which one Fair Play settler felt valuable enough to mention
in his will.<a name="FNanchor_51_224" id="FNanchor_51_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_224" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The fiddle also provided the musical background for
the rollicking reels and jigs which the Scotch-Irish enjoyed so much.<a name="FNanchor_52_225" id="FNanchor_52_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_225" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
That it was a hard life is certainly true, but it had its happy moments
and music was the source of much of that happiness.</p>

<p>Medical practices throughout the frontier were primitive, to say
the least, and the West Branch Valley was no exception. A diary of
a minister in the Susquehanna Valley around Lancaster provides
specific examples of the purges, blood-letting, and herb concoctions
which the frontier settler endured in order to survive.<a name="FNanchor_53_226" id="FNanchor_53_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_226" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In spite of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the liberal use of spirited stimulants, ailing frontiersmen often suffered
violent reactions both from their illnesses and their cures.</p>

<p>Although the Fair Play settlers of the West Branch Valley doubtless
had their own mythology and folklore, most of it was passed on by
word of mouth; as a result, little of record remains. The Revolutionary
pension claims are filled with tales of the courage and patriotism
of the stouthearted men and women of this frontier. A
frequent claim is that the measures taken to defend Fort Augusta,
after the Great Runaway, urged by Fair Play settlers who had fled
to that point, saved the frontier and made independence a reality.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best-known story is that of the "independence elm" on
Pine Creek. However, as a recent writer suggests, the story of the
"Pine Creek Declaration" may refer merely to the reading of a copy
of the national declaration rather than to a separate document drawn
up by the inhabitants of this frontier.<a name="FNanchor_54_227" id="FNanchor_54_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_227" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Mrs. Hamilton's testimony
to the event notwithstanding, no copy of the declaration has ever
been found.</p>

<p>Another tale concerns the frequent reference to the upper Pine
Creek area as "Beulah Land."<a name="FNanchor_55_228" id="FNanchor_55_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_228" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It seems that a circuit rider singing
hymns approached a camp up Pine Creek in the Black Forest. Later,
asked to sing, he offered the familiar "Beulah Land." Still later, he
met with an accident between Blackwell and Cammal resulting in
his death. The entertained were his mourners. Subsequently, they
kept his name alive by singing the old hymn to such an extent that
the name "Beulah Land" became attached to this region on Pine
Creek.</p>

<p>Frontier life afforded little leisure time so that recreation was generally
economically oriented or related to some household task. In
addition, wrestling, foot-racing, jumping, throwing the tomahawk,
and shooting at marks were popular sports.<a name="FNanchor_56_229" id="FNanchor_56_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_229" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But drinking was
probably the most common frontier recreation. It has been said that
the Scotch-Irish made more whiskey and drank more of it than any
other group.<a name="FNanchor_57_230" id="FNanchor_57_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_230" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Everyone drank it, even the ministers. In fact, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
tavern preceded the church as a social center in the West Branch
Valley.<a name="FNanchor_58_231" id="FNanchor_58_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_231" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Moderation, however, was the rule; excessive drinking was
frowned upon.<a name="FNanchor_59_232" id="FNanchor_59_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_232" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The value system of Fair Play society can be analyzed in terms of
the expressed ideals and beliefs, the conduct, and the material possessions
of the pioneers who settled along the West Branch during
this period. Journalists, diarists, and pension claimants offer recorded
evidence of the ideals and beliefs of these settlers. Their actual behavior
gives us some understanding of conduct as value. And finally,
the probate records of the Northumberland and Lycoming County
courts contribute some documentation concerning the material values
of these frontier inhabitants. The result was a society dedicated to
the idea of progress and oriented to a future of political and social
equality and economic opportunity.</p>

<p>A firm conviction concerning the right of property, that is, the
right of individual private ownership, was developed early in the
American experience in Virginia and Massachusetts and was reinforced
by the experience of successive frontiers, of which the Fair
Play territory was one. This is noted particularly in the pride in
individual "improvements" and the vigorous assertion of property
rights before the Fair Play tribunal and, later, in the regular courts.
The large Scotch-Irish population on this and other frontiers characteristically
asserted this view. Motivated by a spirit of individualism
and the desire for a better way of life, the Fair Play settlers found
land ownership basic to the accomplishment of their desired ends.<a name="FNanchor_60_233" id="FNanchor_60_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_233" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In conjunction with the policy of private land ownership, the
support of squatters' rights tended to emphasize the equality of
achievement rather than that of ascription. No man's position was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ascribed in the Fair Play territory&mdash;he had to earn it. However, as
we noted earlier, the pioneer farmer had to obtain the approval of
his neighbors in order to settle in the area; but no evidence exists
to show that this approval was in any way dependent upon social
class or national origin. Furthermore, the annual election of the Fair
Play men by the settlers, along with their rotation in office, gave a
fair measure of political equality, which was reflected in the decisions
of the tribunal affecting land claims.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Fair Play settlers is particularly stressed by
the journalists who traveled in the West Branch Valley.<a name="FNanchor_61_234" id="FNanchor_61_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_234" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Despite
the limitations of rooms and furnishings, the frontier cabin was ever
open to the weary traveler, and spirited conversation and beverages
were always available to revive him. Good food and fine friends
could be found on the frontier. The frontiersman took great pride
in his hospitality. Dependent upon outside travelers for news, the
latest remedies for ailments, and mail, the inhabitants of the frontier
opened the doors of their cabins and their hearts to visitors. Taken
into a home, the weary traveler often found himself treated to the
best in food and comfort which the limitations of the frontier permitted.
Generally sharing the one-room cabin, like any member
of the family, he soon learned that he was a welcome guest rather
than a stranger in their midst. The loneliness of the frontier stimulated
the hospitality of the frontiersman.</p>

<p>Although no "frontier philosophy," as such, existed, the conduct
of its inhabitants demonstrated their faith, their patriotism, their
spirit of mutual helpfulness, and their temperance. The pioneer
was not a philosopher or a thinker, because the rigorous struggle for
survival, which was his, did not permit the leisure to develop these
traits. He was a doer whose values and beliefs were reflected in his
behavior.</p>

<p>The favorable, but not always eager, reception of itinerant pastors,
the religious instruction which took place in the home, and the frequent
references to "the Creator" in the wills testify to the relevance
of faith in influencing the character and behavior of these early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Americans. Faith was not only relevant but also a matter of choice,
and freedom of worship was practiced on this frontier. Here again,
the Scotch-Irish Presbyterian influence may have been significant.<a name="FNanchor_62_235" id="FNanchor_62_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_235" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Patriotism, with few exceptions, was characteristic of the frontier.
But loyalty to what? On this frontier it seems to have meant devotion
to an America which developed through New World experience.
Like Topsy, "it jus' growed," and no frontiersman wanted it taken
away. The enthusiastic reception of the Declaration of Independence
by the Fair Play settlers combined with the legend of their own
resolutions on the question indicate this patriotic feeling. Despite
their political differences with the settled areas, the West Branch
pioneers were overwhelmingly loyal to the patriot cause in the American
Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_63_236" id="FNanchor_63_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_236" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Their loyalty, however, was more to the ideal
of freedom, or "liberty" as they termed it, than to any organization
or state. They believed in and supported the liberty which their own
hard work and the circumstances of the frontier had made possible.</p>

<p>Mutual helpfulness was essential to survival in the wilderness and
valued among its pioneers. Cabin-raisings, cornhuskings, harvesttime,
and quilting parties are just a few examples of this spirit in
action. Individualistic in his approach, the frontier farmer realized
the need for neighborly support and appreciated its offer.</p>

<p>In spite of the availability of a more-than-adequate supply of
spirited liquid refreshment, temperance was both commended and
respected on this Pennsylvania frontier. One historian points out
that there was probably less drunkenness on the frontier than there
was in eastern Pennsylvania, where it was not unusual for young men
to get drunk at the taverns or to drink themselves under the table at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
weddings or at other social functions.<a name="FNanchor_64_237" id="FNanchor_64_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_237" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Drunkards were few and
generally despised on the frontier.<a name="FNanchor_65_238" id="FNanchor_65_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_238" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Material values, in a society where possessions, beyond the land
itself and the rude cabin built upon it, are limited, are best gleaned
from the probate records, which listed the prized possessions of this
frontier community. Beds and bedsteads are the items which appear
most frequently in the wills of the Fair Play settlers. Occasionally,
the ultimate in frontier affluence is reached in the form of a "feather
Bed."<a name="FNanchor_66_239" id="FNanchor_66_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_239" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Beds, or feather beds, and bedsteads were so highly valued
as pieces of furniture that they were often passed on to the daughters,
serving as a substantial part of their dowries.<a name="FNanchor_67_240" id="FNanchor_67_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_240" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Surprisingly
enough, the widow often received "the room she now sleeps in" or,
"her choise of any one room in the house." This is not so amazing,
however, when one realizes that additional rooms beyond the original
one-room cabin quite logically became highly valued. Pewterware was
the silver of the frontier, and, if the probate records are any indication,
there was little of it and no silver. Aside from references to
furniture such as spinning wheels, bureaus, tables, and chairs, and
these not too regularly, it is quite evident that material possessions
were few.</p>

<p>What then was the nature of Fair Play society? The frontier, by
its very nature, had an egalitarian influence which is readily apparent
from this analysis of the "style of life" along the West Branch. A
relative political and social equality existed in this land of economic
opportunity where faith, patriotism, helpfulness, and self-determination
were the outstanding traits. The frontier brought the democratizing
role of achievement to the fore in American life, and the Fair
Play settlers were an excellent example.</p>

refers to the existence of a class in religion among the group of Presbyterians,
although the prospects appear none too favorable. In fact, he says, "I had no
desire to meet the class, so disordered are they, therefore omitted it." Quarterly
meetings of Methodists were also held in the West Branch Valley, as Colbert notes
in his journal for Saturday, Sept. 15, 1792, and Saturday, Sept. 7, 1793. In 1792,
Colbert remarks that "Our Quarterly Meeting began at Joshua White's today."
The following year he wrote that "brother Paynter and I have to hold a Quarterly
meeting at Ammariah Sutton's at Lycommon." Each of these instances indicates
the presence of some sort of voluntary religious association. However, it must be
recalled that Fithian mentioned no such classes or meetings extant during his visit
in July of 1775.</p></div>

Pennsylvania. The Quakers and Pietistic German sects were anti-dogmatic. Dogmatically
adhering to his catechisms, the Scotch-Irishman "resented the aspersions
cast upon dogma and creed." The frontier gave him freedom from the Quakers
who still considered Presbyterians as those "who had burnt a Quaker in New England
from the cart's tail, and had murdered other Quakers."</p></div>

were never a "minority," in the sense that their values differed radically from
the norms of their areas of settlement, they never suffered the normlessness which
Durkheim calls anomie&mdash;the absence of clear standards to follow. As Leyburn states
it,</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Anomie was an experience unknown to the Scotch-Irishman, for he moved
immediately upon arrival to a region where there was neither a settlement
nor an established culture. He held land, knew independence, had manifold
responsibilities from the very outset. He spoke the language of his neighbors
to the East through whose communities he had passed on his way
to the frontier. Their institutions and standards differed at only minor
points from his own. The Scotch-Irish were not, in short, a "minority
group" and needed no Immigrant Aid society to tide them over a period
of maladjustment so that they might become assimilated in the American
melting pot.</p></div>
<p>This, however, is not to suggest that minorities are necessarily anomic. The Jews,
for example, were always a cultural minority in Europe, yet they adhered intensely
to their own cultural norms.</p></div>

settlers came into Lycoming County from New Jersey, but were soon driven out
by the Indians. Apparently, the Philadelphia Baptist Association sent missionaries
to the area in 1775 and 1778. However, not until the association commissioned
Elders Patton, Clingan, and Vaughn in 1792 did any extensive Baptist preaching
take place in this region. They were sent out for three months on the Juniata and
the West Branch. The Loyalsock Baptist Church, established in 1822, is the first
church.</p></div>

from that of Scotland particularly with regard to local autonomy. The
Presbyterian Church, like the United States under the Constitution of 1787, was
federal in its governmental structure, and the autonomy of the local religious
institutions was later carried into politics. Leyburn, <i>The Scotch-Irish</i>, p. 313,
emphasizes the fact that the Scotch-Irishman's church had accustomed him to belief
in government by the consent of the governed, in representative and republican
institutions. The relationship between the church covenant and the social
compact is quite direct. If men can bind themselves together to form a church, then
it seems quite logical that they can bind themselves together to form a government.
Fair Play democracy was simply political Presbyterianism. Its impact has
been noted by a number of historians. Dunaway, <i>The Scotch-Irish of Colonial
Pennsylvania</i>, p. 135, claims that "The actual means by which Pennsylvania was
transformed from a proprietary province into an American commonwealth was
the new political organization developed by the Scotch-Irish in alliance with the
eastern radical leaders of the continental Revolutionary movement. This extra-legal
organization, consisting of the committee of safety, the provincial and county
committees of correspondence, and the provincial conventions, supplanted the regular
provincial government by absorbing its functions." Becker, <i>Beginning of the
American People</i>, p. 180, calls the Scotch-Irish a people "whose religion confirmed
them in a democratic habit of mind."</p></div>

<h3 class="ity"><big>Leadership and the Problems of the Frontier</big></h3>


<p>Any analysis of democracy in the Fair Play territory must
consider the question of leadership and the particular problems
of that frontier. The number of leaders and their roles,
the marks of leadership, and the circumstances which brought certain
men to the fore must all be considered. Was there some correlation
between property-holdings, or national origin, and leadership?
Were there certain offices conducive to the exercise of leadership?
The subject of leadership entails inquiry into each of these areas.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, only one biographical study of any Fair Play leader
has ever been attempted, that of Henry Antes.<a name="FNanchor_1_241" id="FNanchor_1_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_241" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As a result, the patterns
of leadership must be gleaned from court records, tax lists,
lists of public officials, and petitions from the settlers of this frontier.
Consequently, what follows gives us some general understanding of
the nature of leadership but offers little in the way of insight into
the personalities of the leaders.</p>

<p>Using the Curti study as an example, certain objective criteria have
been set up in analyzing leadership in the West Branch Valley.<a name="FNanchor_2_242" id="FNanchor_2_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_242" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Obviously, some leaders were more important than others. Their
influence extended beyond the limits of the Fair Play territory.
These leaders, provided that they stood out in respect to at least
three of the four criteria established, have been categorized as regional
leaders. These four criteria have been used in this study to
determine regional leadership: (1) the holding of political office,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
(2) the ownership of better-than-average property holdings, (3) the
operation of frontier forts, and (4) the holding of military rank of
some significance.<a name="FNanchor_3_243" id="FNanchor_3_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_243" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Of these criteria, office holding appears to be the most important.
Thus, regional leaders were generally re-elected to public office, or
held more than one such office. Furthermore, it will be noted that
these offices tended to be with the established governments of the
State and county. Since some leaders never held any political office,
another classification seemed necessary. Consequently, the role of
local leadership was also classified.</p>

<p>The influence of some men seems to have been strictly confined to
the Fair Play territory, either by virtue of their election to some local
office or by their prominence in some other phase of community life.
As a result, local leaders have been considered as (1) those who
held at least two local offices, or (2) those who exercised identifiable
community leadership in a non-political context.</p>

<p>After an extensive examination of the lists of public officials for
Northumberland County, the tax lists for the same period, the records
of the Fair Play men and the Committee of Safety, the accounts of
the frontier forts in the region, and the military records of these
settlers, it becomes evident that only three men can be considered as
regional leaders and not more than seven or eight as local leaders.<a name="FNanchor_4_244" id="FNanchor_4_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_244" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Henry Antes, Robert Fleming, and Frederick Antes are the regional
leaders; and Alexander Hamilton, John Fleming, James Crawford,
John Walker, Thomas Hughes, Cookson Long, William Reed, and
Samuel Horn are the local leaders. Obviously, the listings are too
limited to offer any valid quantitative analysis.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>Henry Antes is undoubtedly the single most outstanding leader in
the entire Fair Play country. Judge of the Court of Quarter Sessions,
sheriff, justice of the peace, Fair Play spokesman, captain (later
colonel) of Associators and commander of Fort Antes, miller and
property owner, personal friend of John Dickinson and other Provincial
leaders, Henry Antes was the top figure in civic, economic, military,
and social affairs along the West Branch. Influential within and
without the Fair Play territory, Henry Antes was truly the major
leader in the valley.</p>

<p>The Antes family had long played a significant role in the history
of the Province of Pennsylvania. As MacMinn relates, Henry's father,
Henry, Sr., had been "associated with the most prominent men of
his time in movements for the public good."<a name="FNanchor_5_245" id="FNanchor_5_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_245" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A Moravian, the elder
Antes had assisted Count Zinzendorf in his missionary efforts, aided
Whitefield in his philanthropic endeavors, worked with Henry
Muhlenberg in educating the German town community, and served
with a marked impartiality as a justice of the peace.<a name="FNanchor_6_246" id="FNanchor_6_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_246" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> From such
stock came the necessary leadership for the Fair Play settlers of the
West Branch frontier.</p>

<p>Born near Pottstown in Montgomery County in 1736, young Henry
may have learned of frontier opportunity from visitors to his father's
inn, such as Zinzendorf and Spangenburg, who had traveled along
the West Branch of the Susquehanna. Consequently, joined by his
brother William, he signed an article of agreement on September 29,
1773, for the purchase of land in the West Branch Valley.<a name="FNanchor_7_247" id="FNanchor_7_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_247" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> When
another brother, Frederick, obtained property in the area later in
that same decade, the Antes brothers, particularly Henry and Frederick,
became the dominant political, economic, and social influence in the
territory. Frederick, however, was more of an absentee leader since
he never actually resided in the Fair Play territory.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the combined holdings of the Antes brothers constituted
only a little less than 700 acres, their gristmill, the first in the region,
became the meeting place for the area settlers, providing a forum for
the usual discussions of politics and prices.<a name="FNanchor_8_248" id="FNanchor_8_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_248" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> From Lycoming Creek
on the east to Pine Creek and the Great Island on the west, the
frontier farmers brought their grain to the Antes mill, on the south
side of the Susquehanna River opposite present Jersey Shore. While
the milling went on, the men analyzed their common problems and
debated the future of this pioneer land. If there was a center for
the dissemination of news in the West Branch Valley, it was the Antes
mill and fort, which was soon constructed on the property. Located
in almost the center of the Fair Play territory (although actually
across the river from it), where men met of necessity, and having had
a father who had exerted influence and exercised leadership in Philadelphia
County, the Antes brothers were well prepared to lead the
West Branch pioneers.</p>

<p>With their gristmill giving Henry and Frederick a decided economic
edge, they soon became involved in the politics of the Fair
Play territory, Northumberland County, and the Province of Pennsylvania.
Henry became primarily a local and county leader, while
his brother concentrated on county and Provincial and, later, State
affairs. Both served as county judges&mdash;Henry, appointed in 1775, and
Frederick, elected in 1784&mdash;which suggests judicial responsibility as
the key to assuming major leadership, since Robert Fleming took
Frederick's judicial post when he resigned to take a seat in the
General Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_9_249" id="FNanchor_9_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_249" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>By the summer of 1775, when Philip Vickers Fithian first included
the West Branch in his itinerary&mdash;the valley by then supported some
100 families&mdash;Henry Antes had already distinguished himself as a
public servant. He, along with five others, had been commissioned
by the county court to lay out a road from Fort Augusta to the mouth
of Bald Eagle Creek;<a name="FNanchor_10_250" id="FNanchor_10_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_250" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he had served as a spokesman for the Fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Play men in a land title dispute;<a name="FNanchor_11_251" id="FNanchor_11_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_251" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he had been made a justice of
the peace;<a name="FNanchor_12_252" id="FNanchor_12_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_252" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and he had been appointed as a judge of the Court of
Quarter Sessions.<a name="FNanchor_13_253" id="FNanchor_13_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_253" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This was to be only the beginning, for in 1775,
when the Associators were organized, Henry Antes was made captain
of company eight, embodying the Nippenose and Pine Creek settlers.<a name="FNanchor_14_254" id="FNanchor_14_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_254" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
But even this is not the complete picture, for when the settlers returned
to the region in the eighties, following the Great Runaway of
1778, Antes became sheriff, the chief law enforcement officer of
Northumberland County.<a name="FNanchor_15_255" id="FNanchor_15_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_255" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The popular miller had become the
popular leader, a popularity enhanced by his interpretation of the
sheriff's role, an interpretation which occasionally brought him into
conflict with the State's leaders.<a name="FNanchor_16_256" id="FNanchor_16_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_256" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The leadership of the Antes brothers is further accentuated by the
activities of Frederick Antes. Between 1776 and 1784 he was a delegate
to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention, justice of the
peace, president judge of the county courts, county treasurer, commissioner
of purchase for Northumberland County, a representative
in the General Assembly, and a colonel of militia.<a name="FNanchor_17_257" id="FNanchor_17_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_257" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> With Henry on
the West Branch and Frederick frequently in Philadelphia, the Antes
family had a constant finger on the pulse of Pennsylvania politics.
Official duties, plus the strategic location of the Antes fort and mill,
made Frederick and Henry Antes the most influential persons in the
West Branch Valley during the operation of the Fair Play system.
Eminently qualified by numerous public responsibilities, the Antes
brothers were major leaders of the Fair Play settlers.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>Robert Fleming, the third regional leader in the territory, also
served as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the county, although
that service began in March, 1785, after the Fair Play territory
was acquired by the State of Pennsylvania in the second Stanwix
Treaty of 1784.<a name="FNanchor_18_258" id="FNanchor_18_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_258" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He became a justice of the peace at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_19_259" id="FNanchor_19_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_259" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Prior to his judicial obligations, Fleming had been a member of the
county Committee of Safety, a township overseer, a representative in
the General Assembly, a second lieutenant of Associators, and possibly
a Fair Play man.<a name="FNanchor_20_260" id="FNanchor_20_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_260" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> During the Revolution, he was primarily
concerned with the area around the Great Island, serving at Reed's
Fort (present Lock Haven) and on the Fleming estate, which some
referred to as Fort Fleming. Robert had a brother, John, with whom
Fithian stayed during his brief sojourn in the territory. Their combined
holdings, the largest in the vicinity, ran to almost 3,000 acres,
of which 1,250 acres were Robert's.<a name="FNanchor_21_261" id="FNanchor_21_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_261" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Certain conclusions can be drawn from these data regarding the
regional leaders of the Fair Play territory. Better than average property
holdings, extensive in the case of Robert Fleming; judicial
responsibility, which was true of all three men; primary authority
in frontier forts (the Antes brothers owned and commanded Antes
Fort, and the Flemings operated their own stockade and commanded
Fort Reed); and military rank ranging from lieutenant of Associators
to colonel of militia: these characteristics signified major leadership
in the West Branch Valley among the Fair Play settlers. Coincidentally,
it can be noted that two of the three regional leaders, having
served in the State legislature, had influence which reached to the
State House in Philadelphia. Obviously, these men were known outside
of the limited environs of the Fair Play territory. In fact, both
Henry and Frederick Antes enjoyed a more than passing acquaintance
with Benjamin Franklin and John Dickinson, two of the giants of
this period of Pennsylvania's history.<a name="FNanchor_22_262" id="FNanchor_22_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_262" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>A further observation which can be made concerning leadership
relates to the question of national origin. Although the Fair Play
territory has often been referred to as "Scotch-Irish country," the
German Antes brothers performed the outstanding leadership roles
on this frontier. Also, the specific geographic location of our regional
leaders provides a final note of interest. All three of them, Henry and
Frederick Antes, and Robert Fleming, actually resided outside the
limits of the Fair Play territory. They were on the geographic fringe
but at the leadership core. Their close proximity to the Fair Play
territory, separated from it only by the Susquehanna River, in addition
to their contacts with and positions in established government,
gave these men an obvious political eminence. The forts located in
both places and the Anteses' gristmill gave both the Flemings and
the Anteses opportunity for leadership.</p>

<p>Local leaders generally lived within the Fair Play territory, had
average property holdings, and served on either the Fair Play tribunal
or the township Committee of Safety. There are, of course, exceptions
to each of these generalizations. The fort operators, Samuel Horn,
William Reed, and John Fleming, resided on the Provincial or State
side of the Susquehanna River. Furthermore, John Fleming was the
largest property owner in the area with some 1,640 acres.<a name="FNanchor_23_263" id="FNanchor_23_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_263" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And
one man, James Crawford, held the highly respected county office of
sheriff.<a name="FNanchor_24_264" id="FNanchor_24_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_264" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Three of the local leaders, John Fleming, Alexander Hamilton, and
James Crawford, stand out from the rest, although for different reasons.
John Fleming undoubtedly would have become a major leader
had he lived longer&mdash;he died in 1777. His extensive property made
his home the usual stop for itinerant pastors and other travelers in
the valley, as Fithian's <i>Journal</i> attests.<a name="FNanchor_25_265" id="FNanchor_25_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_265" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It also made him a figure of
central significance in economic affairs. Alexander Hamilton was
probably "the" local leader. A member of the Committee of Safety
and presumably a Fair Play man, he was also the captain of Horn's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Fort.<a name="FNanchor_26_266" id="FNanchor_26_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_266" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He is also the reputed author of the Pine Creek declaration.
James Crawford was more noted for military exploits than for
civic duties. Prior to his military service, Crawford had represented
Northumberland County in the Constitutional Convention of 1776,
which framed the State constitution and, later, commissioned him
as a major in the Twelfth Pennsylvania Regiment.<a name="FNanchor_27_267" id="FNanchor_27_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_267" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Deprived of his
commission after the Germantown campaign, Major Crawford returned
home and was elected county sheriff, an office which he held
until succeeded by Henry Antes.<a name="FNanchor_28_268" id="FNanchor_28_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_268" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Of the other local leaders, Horn and Reed held only lesser
township offices, overseer and supervisor, respectively, in addition to
operating frontier forts.<a name="FNanchor_29_269" id="FNanchor_29_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_269" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Cookson Long, mentioned as a Fair Play
man in 1775 in Eleanor Coldren's deposition, later commanded Fort
Reed, for a time, as a captain of Associators.<a name="FNanchor_30_270" id="FNanchor_30_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_270" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The final two local
leaders, John Walker and Thomas Hughes, both took turns as Fair
Play men and as members of the local Committee of Safety.<a name="FNanchor_31_271" id="FNanchor_31_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_271" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In analyzing the local leadership roles which these various settlers
filled, additional and pertinent conclusions become apparent. In the
first place, the Fair Play men were obviously not the top leaders of
the community. Henry Antes may have served as their spokesman
in 1775, and it is quite possible that Robert Fleming was a member
of the tribunal, but both were more important as county leaders.
Secondly, Fair Play men were members of the Committee of Safety,
a fact which suggests that their efforts may have been coordinated.
Finally, returning to the question of national origin, six of these
eight local leaders were either Scots, Scotch-Irish, or Irish. The
other two were Germans. No Englishman was a leader, either regional
or local, in the Fair Play territory between 1769 and 1784.
Perhaps, as Carl Becker suggests, this was due to the fact that neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the German nor the Scotch-Irish immigrant held in his breast any
sentiment of loyalty to King George, or much sympathy with the
traditions or the leaders of English society.<a name="FNanchor_32_272" id="FNanchor_32_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_272" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>What were the particular problems of this frontier and how effective
were these leaders in meeting them? The question of defense,
including the daily task of survival in the wilderness, the right of pre-emption,
and the efforts to obtain frontier representation in the
assembly: these were the main problems in this pioneer land along
the West Branch of the Susquehanna. All were not solved during the
period under analysis, but the attempts to solve these and other problems
afford us the opportunity to evaluate the leadership in the Fair
Play territory.</p>

<p>Doubtless, the most pressing public need on this frontier was
protection from the marauding Indians who plagued these pioneers
throughout the fifteen years encompassed by this study. Aroused by
the British during the Revolution, the Indians of the Six Nations
descended from New York into the West Branch Valley to harass
and, finally, to drive the Fair Play settlers from their homes. Driven
from their homes, the frontiersmen of the West Branch first gathered
in the hastily-constructed and poorly-manned forts conveniently scattered
along the Susquehanna from Jersey Shore to Lock Haven, but,
ultimately, these too had to be evacuated in the Great Runaway in
1778.</p>

<p>The severity of these attacks is evident from this petition from the
settlers gathered at Fort Horn, above present McElhattan, pleading for
military support in their perilous position:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>To the Honourable the Supreame Executive Councill of the
Commonwealth of Pennsyllvania, in Lancaster;</i></p>

Eagle Township, on the West Branch of Susquehannah,

</div>

<p>This petition was signed by some forty-seven settlers, including
John and Robert Fleming, Alexander Hamilton, and Samuel Horn.
Unfortunately, the much-needed assistance was not forthcoming, and
Colonel Hunter soon sent instructions from Fort Augusta for the
evacuation of the valley. This evacuation is, of course, the Great Runaway.<a name="FNanchor_34_274" id="FNanchor_34_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_274" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
It is interesting to note, however, that the bearer of this petition
was Robert Fleming, one of the regional leaders of the territory.</p>

<p>Although forced to leave the West Branch Valley, the Fair Play
settlers responded to Colonel Hunter's fervent plea to stay at Fort
Augusta to help in the defense of this last frontier. Their gallant
stand on the West Branch and their earnestly successful support of
Fort Augusta, the last frontier outpost in central Pennsylvania, protected
the interior, enabled the Continental Congress "to function
in safety at a period when its collapse would have meant total disaster
to the American cause," and provided a vivid demonstration of what
a later president of the United States would call "that last full
measure of devotion."<a name="FNanchor_35_275" id="FNanchor_35_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_275" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>In the fall of 1778, following the earlier alliance with France, the
tide of the Revolution began to flow in favor of independence, notwithstanding
the fact that the Fair Play territory was now deserted.
But for two years previous, when the issue of independence had been
in grave doubt, the courageous pioneers of the West Branch stood
their ground in tiny garrisons at Fort Antes, Fort Horn, and Fort
Reed, resisting the attacking Indians at the insistence of their leaders,
that freedom might be preserved. Perhaps it is a little-known story,
but the fate of independence was in good hands with the Fair Play
settlers of the West Branch Valley, who fought to preserve it.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Revolution the Fair Play settlers returned
to the territory, and a new problem arose, that of title claims or,
more particularly, the right of pre-emption. Still outside the bounds
of the Commonwealth and organized government, these frontier squatters
petitioned the Supreme Council for validation of their land
claims.<a name="FNanchor_36_276" id="FNanchor_36_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_276" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Two petitions, one in August, 1781, and the other in
March, 1784, were sent. Their claims were recognized by an act of
the General Assembly passed in May, 1785.<a name="FNanchor_37_277" id="FNanchor_37_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_277" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> By this time, the land
in question had been opened for settlement by virtue of the
Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784. Needless to say, their petitions had
been prompted in part by fear of land speculators who were attempting
to buy up their lands through the Land Office in Philadelphia.
The prominence of local leaders, such as Alexander Hamilton and
John Walker, is once again noted in these petitions. These petitions
achieved notable results in that the right of pre-emption for the West
Branch squatters was recognized by the Commonwealth long before
the national government endorsed the principle. Furthermore, the
validation of these claims beyond the purchase line of the Stanwix
Treaty of 1768 provided the first legal recognition of pre-emption in
the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful in maintaining their homes against the incursive
Indians, but successful in regaining them by right of pre-emption,
the Fair Play settlers were also vitally concerned with representative
democracy. Locally, on the county level, and in the Province and
State, these frontiersmen sought to make their wishes known, both to
and through their political leaders. How well they achieved these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
goals was influenced by the number of persons whom they elected
to both legal and extra-legal offices at the various political levels.</p>

<p>The Fair Play settlers managed to send two of their associates to
the General Assembly in the decade after Lexington and Concord.<a name="FNanchor_38_278" id="FNanchor_38_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_278" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
These two, Robert Fleming and Frederick Antes, constituted a disproportionate
representation, when one considers the limited population
of the Fair Play community and the general under-representation
of the frontier counties at this period. In fact, a few hundred
families in and around the West Branch were surprisingly fortunate
to have one of their number, Robert Fleming, in the General Assembly
when, following a petition from the frontier counties in 1776, a
new apportionment created an assembly in which fifty-eight legislators
represented Pennsylvania's 300,000 people.<a name="FNanchor_39_279" id="FNanchor_39_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_279" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> However, the elections
of both Fleming and Antes came after the new constitution of 1776,
in which each county was given six representatives.<a name="FNanchor_40_280" id="FNanchor_40_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_280" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It can hardly
be said that the West Branch Valley lacked adequate representation
in the councils of the State.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Frederick Antes was a delegate to that State Constitutional
Convention. This not only emphasizes the leadership role
of Antes, but also points up the good fortune of the Fair Play settlers
in having one of their community participate in the framing of the
new State government. Although the Fair Play settlers lived beyond
the legal limits of settlement, they were very much involved in its
political affairs.</p>

<p>Aside from the General Assembly and the Constitutional Convention,
these pioneers of the Northumberland County frontier placed
three men on the county bench, one of whom was presiding judge.<a name="FNanchor_41_281" id="FNanchor_41_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_281" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Fair Play men became justices of fair play in the county courts.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Concerning other county offices, the key position of sheriff was held
continuously from 1779 to 1785 by members of the Fair Play community.<a name="FNanchor_42_282" id="FNanchor_42_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_282" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Here again, it appears that the proper administration of
justice could be expected from Fair Play men.</p>

<p>Locally, the rotational system of the Fair Play tribunal and the
frequent changes in the composition of the Committee of Safety give
rise to the conclusion that political democracy, in the sense of active
participation in public office, was truly a characteristic of the Fair
Play territory. Nine different men served on the three-man Committee
of Safety from February of 1776 to February of 1777, three new
members being elected semi-annually. Except for the two or three
years following the Great Runaway, the three members of the Fair
Play tribunal were elected annually.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, what can be said regarding the leadership of
the Fair Play settlers? Except for the dangers from Indian hostility,
which were compounded by the settlers' limited manpower, the leadership
was more than adequate, one might say eminently successful, in
meeting the needs of the frontier. It enacted law, interpreted it, and
saw to it that the law was carried out on every political level with
which the West Branch pioneers had contact. In short, it gave them
a government of, by, and for themselves. This was <i>real</i> representation
by spokesmen of a small community, very different from <i>virtual</i> representation
in a distant Parliament, from which their independence
had now been declared.</p>

<h3 class="ity"><big>Democracy on the Pennsylvania Frontier</big></h3>


<p>One of the most often used and least understood words in
the American lexicon is the term "democracy." In the colonial
period, it was seldom used, except in denunciation. However,
properly defined, it can help us to evaluate the Fair Play settlers in
some understandable context. Etymologically stemming from two
Greek words, <i>demos</i>, meaning "the people," and <i>kratos</i>, meaning
"authority," democracy means "authority in the people" or, we can
say, "self-determination." By self-determination is meant the right
of the people to decide their own political, economic, and social
institutions.</p>

<p>Self-determination in its basic, or political, context can best be
explained through James Bryce's definition of a democracy. Lord
Bryce said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word Democracy has been used ever since the time
of Herodotus to denote that form of government in which
the ruling power of a State is legally vested, not in any particular
class or classes, but in the members of the community
as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_1_283" id="FNanchor_1_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_283" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>Analyzing the key phrases in Bryce's statement, we can best clarify
the meaning of political self-determination.</p>

<p>(1) "The ruling power of a State." Self-determination, as it is
employed here, concerns the right of the people of Fair Play society
to determine their own political institutions. Fair Play society did
not constitute a state, but it was a political community, and in that
sense Bryce's definition applies. Living outside the legal limit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
settlement of Province and Commonwealth, these people could not
obtain legal authority for their own rule, so, following the prevalent
theory of the social compact, they formed their own government.
The result was the annual election, by the people, of the Fair Play
tribunal, the source of final authority in the Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>(2) "Is legally vested." Fair Play society was actually illegal; that
is to say, the settlements were made in violation of the laws of the
Province. However, the extra-legal government which was formed
was created by, and responsive to, the popular will. Since the actual
authority for rule was vested in the people, it can be considered as
legal for the Fair Play community.</p>

<p>(3) "In the members of the community." The members of the
Fair Play community, as previously noted, were not strictly resident
within the geographic confines of the Fair Play territory. Communities,
it has been said, are total ways of life, complexes Of behavior composed
of all the institutions necessary to carry on a complete life,
formed into a working whole.<a name="FNanchor_2_284" id="FNanchor_2_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_284" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Self-determination, as it is used here,
suggests that the community as a whole participates in the decision-making
process.</p>

<p>(4) "Not in any particular class or classes, but in the members of
the community as a whole." Bryce's definition here extends the interpretation
of "the members of the community." Obviously, if any
particular class or classes were vested with the final political authority,
then the people as a whole, that is, the Fair Play community, would
not exercise self-determination.</p>

<p>The concept of self-determination, carried to an economic context,
suggests that the people of the Fair Play community had the right
to determine their own economic institutions. This means that they
had the right to choose their own portion of land, subject, of course,
to the will of the existing community, and to utilize it according to
their own needs and interests. This meant that no undemocratic and
feudalistic practices, such as primogeniture and entail, could exist.
Granted that this is self-determination rather broadly interpreted in
an economic context, the question is whether or not these people had
the right to choose their own plot of ground and work it as they saw
fit, unhampered by any preordained system of discrimination or
restriction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Socially, the idea of self-determination is applied to evaluate the religious
institutions, the class structure, and the value system. The
application concerns, once again, the authority of the people to determine
their own social patterns. It questions whether or not any
Fair Play settler could worship according to the dictates of his own
conscience. It evaluates the class structure to ascertain whether or not
a superimposed caste system ordered the class structure of Fair Play
society, rather than a community-determined system in which choice
and opportunity provided flexibility and mobility. And finally, it
considers whether or not the values of the Fair Play settlers were inculcated
by some internal clique or external force, rather than being
developed by the members of the community themselves.</p>

<p>Did democracy exist on this Pennsylvania frontier? Was the Fair
Play system marked by real representation and popular control? These
questions must be answered before any judgment can be made concerning
political democracy in the West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>Was there equality of economic opportunity on this farmers' frontier?
Was land available to all who sought it, and on equal terms?
These problems need to be considered before we can attach the label
"democratic" on the economic life of the Fair Play settlers.</p>

<p>If democracy prizes diversity, as some claim, were the diverse elements
of Fair Play society equally recognized?<a name="FNanchor_3_285" id="FNanchor_3_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_285" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Was the class structure
open or closed, mobile or fixed? Did the mixed national stocks
enjoy religious freedom? One needs to inquire into each of these
areas prior to a final evaluation of Fair Play society.</p>

<p>A useful tool for evaluating political democracy can be found in
Ranney and Kendall's <i>Democracy and the American Party System</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_286" id="FNanchor_4_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_286" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It suggests the use of popular sovereignty, political equality, popular
consultation, and majority rule as criteria for democracy. Accepting
these criteria as basic principles of democracy, we can begin to
analyze the democratic character of the Fair Play system.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>A political system based upon popular sovereignty is one in which
the final authority to rule is vested in the people. The question of
who the people are is still before us today. In the fullest sense, popular
sovereignty means rule by all the people, but in colonial America
the "people" was a much more qualified term. It generally signified
white, Protestant, adult males who were property owners. In the Fair
Play territory, the ruling "people" were "the whole body" of adult
male settlers who annually elected their governing tribunal and participated
in the decisions of its "court."<a name="FNanchor_5_287" id="FNanchor_5_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_287" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Lacking an established
church, or any church for that matter, and possessing property lying
beyond legal limits of settlement, the Fair Play settlers could not
have enforced religious or property qualifications for voting, even if
they had so desired, and there is no evidence to indicate that they
did. Furthermore, the frequency of elections, which were held annually,
and the principle of rotating the offices among the settlers
tended to emphasize the sovereignty of the people in this part of the
West Branch Valley. The right of suffrage, it is true, had not been
extended to women, but this was the rule throughout colonial America.
Popular sovereignty, in its qualified eighteenth-century sense, was
a basic characteristic of the political democracy which existed on this
frontier.</p>

<p>Political equality, that is "one man, one vote," was practiced by
the pioneers of the West Branch. There was no additional vote given
to the large property owners; in fact, as the tax lists indicate, there
were no large property owners within the geographic limits of the
Fair Play territory. Thus, each man, rather than a small ruling
oligarchy, had the opportunity to participate in the decision-making
process of the Fair Play community.</p>

<p>In a democratic society, the people must be consulted by the policy
makers prior to their exercise of the power of decision. Among the
Fair Play settlers this basically democratic principle was vividly demonstrated
in the case of disputed land titles, the primary concern of
the Fair Play men. In both Eleanor Coldren's deposition in behalf
of her deceased husband and in the Huff-Latcha case, it was established
that the unanimous consent of the prospective neighbors had
to be obtained before a favorable decision was rendered in behalf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the land claimants.<a name="FNanchor_6_288" id="FNanchor_6_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_288" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The frequency of elections, combined
with the ease and regularity of assembly, provided the settlers with
the opportunity to become acquainted with the circumstances of
their problems. Here again, the paucity of specific data prompts us
to some speculation regarding the nature and location of these meetings.
However, it must be added, the Hamilton pension papers and
the petitions to the Supreme Council in Philadelphia refer specifically
to meetings at Fort Horn and Fort Antes.<a name="FNanchor_7_289" id="FNanchor_7_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_289" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Direct representation
based upon popular consultation was a distinct trait of the political
democracy in the Fair Play territory.</p>

<p>The fourth principle of political democracy, majority rule, is probably
the most controversial and confusing element of the combination.
Absolute majority rule, its critics tell us, means majority "tyranny"
and minority acquiescence, despite the fact that this fear is not empirically
demonstrable.<a name="FNanchor_8_290" id="FNanchor_8_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_290" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The majority ruled absolutely in the Fair
Play territory just as it did in the New England town meeting, and
with similar results. However, it never restricted suffrage or public
office to particular religious or nationality groups. Scotch-Irish,
English, and German settlers participated equally in the political
process. However, as we pointed out in the last chapter, the English
did not enjoy leadership roles in the community.<a name="FNanchor_9_291" id="FNanchor_9_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_291" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Whether this was
by accident or by design is difficult to ascertain. Perhaps it was just
a further demonstration of the absolute rule of the majority with the
Scotch-Irish and the Germans combining to form that majority.</p>

<p>The nature of community implies shared interests and the prevailing
interest in this frontier community was survival. Necessity undoubtedly
caused the English minority to accept the Scotch-Irish and
German leadership, because forbearance meant survival. Conversely,
the Scotch-Irish and Germans could, and did, support the English in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
positions of responsibility on the basis of their mutual needs and
their desire to maintain the community.<a name="FNanchor_10_292" id="FNanchor_10_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_292" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Not only physical survival
but also economic survival were mutually desirable to Fair Play
community members, and the decisions of the court were rendered on
the basis of equal justice.<a name="FNanchor_11_293" id="FNanchor_11_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_293" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>As long as minority feelings are given free expression in an atmosphere
of mutual concern, there is little danger of misinterpretation
by the majority. Such a climate prevailed in the meetings of the
Fair Play settlers and the sessions of the Fair Play men; at least, there
is no available evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>The nature and role of consensus in the Fair Play territory hinged
upon what was best for the community. Fundamental agreement was
reached, based upon mutual need apparent from open discussion.
In the event of conflict, forbearance, which was in the best interest
of the community, could be expected.<a name="FNanchor_12_294" id="FNanchor_12_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_294" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> An examination of the appearance
dockets of the county courts for Northumberland and Lycoming
counties suggests, however, that this consensus did not extend
to questions of land titles. Nevertheless, the all-inclusiveness of signatures
on petitions to the Supreme Executive Council for protection
from the Indians and for the recognition of the right of pre-emption,
and the general response of the Fair Play settlers to calls for troops
for the Continental Army indicate to some degree the nature and extent
of that consensus.<a name="FNanchor_13_295" id="FNanchor_13_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_295" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Democracy, that is self-determination, did exist among the Fair
Play settlers of this Pennsylvania frontier. There was no outside authority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
which legislated the affairs of the pioneers of the West Branch.
They selected their own representatives, the Fair Play men, and
maintained their control over them, a control which was assured both
by annual elections and the full participation of the settlers in the
decision-making process. The will of the majority prevailed, and that
will was expressed through a community consensus reached by the full
participation of political equals. It was neither radical nor revolutionary,
but it was typical of the American colonial experience. The
Fair Play settlers had not "jumped the gun" on independence, although
they participated in the movement. They did not rebel
against a ruling aristocracy. They simply governed themselves.</p>

<p>Self-determination, as we have already stated, includes the right of
the people to decide upon their own economic institutions. This right
was asserted on the farmers' frontier of the West Branch. With free
land available to those who worked it, provided the neighbors and
the Fair Play men approved, economic opportunity was shared by the
Scotch-Irish, English, German, Scots, Irish, Welsh, and French settlers.<a name="FNanchor_14_296" id="FNanchor_14_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_296" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This sharing, in itself, was a demonstration of economic democracy.</p>

<p>The labor system, too, was an affirmation of the democratic ideal.
Because free land was available in the Fair Play territory, neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude existed in this region, although it
was found in immediately adjacent areas.<a name="FNanchor_15_297" id="FNanchor_15_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_297" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Free labor, family labor
to be more exact, was the system employed in this portion of the
West Branch Valley. Noticeable, too, was the spirit of cooperation
in such enterprises as cabin-raisings, barn-raisings, harvesting, cornhuskings
and the like. This mutual helpfulness was characteristic of
the frontier and obviated the necessity of any enforced labor system.</p>

<p>Tenancy was occasionally practiced in the Fair Play territory, although
it appears that the tenant farmer suffered no feelings of inferiority,
if the following case is any example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... Peter Dewitt ... leased the land in question to William
McIlhatton as a Cropper, who took possession of it after
Huggins left it: That the Terms of the Lease were that McIlhatton
should possess the Land about two or three Years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
rendering hold of the Crops to be raised unto Peter Dewitt,
who was to find him a Team and farming Utensils: That
the Lease was in Writing and Lodged with a certain Daniel
Cruger who lived in the Neighborhood at that Time.<a name="FNanchor_16_298" id="FNanchor_16_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_298" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>Sometime later, McElhattan obtained the lease from Cruger and
sold "his right" to William Dunn, claiming that Dewitt had failed
to fill his end of the bargain, despite the fact that Eleanor Coldren
gave evidence to the contrary. When challenged for selling Dewitt's
land, McElhattan responded in a fashion which demonstrates the independent
spirit of this lessee. He said "that he only sold his Right
to Dunn and if Dunn would be such a fool as to give him forty or
fifty pounds for Nothing He McIlhatton would be a greater fool for
not taking it&mdash;for that Dunn knew what Right he (McIlhatton)
had."<a name="FNanchor_17_299" id="FNanchor_17_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_299" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Obviously, if this case is indicative, and there were others,
share-cropping did not induce attitudes of subservience.</p>

<p>Religious freedom, in which Pennsylvania ranked second only to
Rhode Island in colonial America, was enjoyed by the frontiersmen
of the West Branch. It might, however, be better described as a
freedom from religion rather than a freedom of religion. With no
system of local taxation and no regular church, there was no establishment
of religion. Nevertheless, this is not to suggest that religious
qualifications were not applied to prospective landowners, potential
voters, or members of the Fair Play community. Religious liberty had
been guaranteed to Pennsylvanians in the Charter of Privileges of
1701, and no religious test was required for suffrage in the new State
constitution in 1776. Belief in one God and in the inspiration of the
Scriptures was required for members of the assembly, but bona fide
Fair Play settlers were disqualified on geographic grounds anyhow.<a name="FNanchor_18_300" id="FNanchor_18_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_300" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>There is no record of religious discrimination among the Fair Play
settlers. In addition to the absence of a regular church, this was
probably due, in part, to the religious composition of the population.
The pioneers of the West Branch were Protestant Christians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and if denominational in their approach, either Presbyterian or Methodist.
The friction between Methodists and Presbyterians appears to
have been doctrinal rather than political or social.<a name="FNanchor_19_301" id="FNanchor_19_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_301" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The comparative economic equality in an area of free land had
a democratizing influence on the social class structure. This three-class
stratification, composed of property owners distinguished by their
morality, other property owners, and tenants, was an open-class system
marked by a noticeable degree of mobility. Fair Play settlers who
began as tenants could, and did, become property owners.</p>

<p>Since no one in the Fair Play territory could claim more than 300
acres under the Pre-Emption Act of 1785, there was little chance for
the development of an aristocratic class.<a name="FNanchor_20_302" id="FNanchor_20_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_302" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was a society of achievement
in which the race was open to anyone who could acquire land,
with the approval of his neighbors and the Fair Play men, and "improve"
it. There is no evidence to indicate that the availability of
land was restricted because of national origin, religious affiliation, or
a previous condition of servitude. This is not to say that the judgments
of neighbors may not have been based upon these criteria, but,
at least, there is no record of such discrimination. The Fair Play settlers
were eighteenth-century souls and romantic egalitarianism was
not a characteristic of such persons. The frontier, however, broke
"the cake of custom" and the necessities of that experience contributed
to the development of democracy as we have defined it.</p>

<p>A recent writer, analyzing the "democracy" of the Scotch-Irish, made
his evaluation on the basis of the contemporary French definition of
liberty, equality, and fraternity.<a name="FNanchor_21_303" id="FNanchor_21_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_303" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> On this basis, the Scotch-Irish fail;
but if we equate democracy with self-determination, the Scotch-Irish
and the Fair Play settlers of the West Branch Valley can be seen as
thoroughgoing democrats.</p>

<p>The value system of the pioneers on the West Branch of the Susquehanna
reflected, at least in part, the democracy of the frontier. The
spirit of cooperation and mutual helpfulness was a prime characteristic
of this frontier, as it was of others. Cabin-raisings, barn-raisings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and the cooperative enterprises at harvesttime enhanced the spirit of
community and brought the settlers together in common efforts, which
demonstrated their equality. Individualism could be harnessed for
the common good, and such was the case among the Fair Play settlers
in the struggle for economic survival.</p>

<p>Faith, patriotism, and temperance were not necessarily democratic,
but they also were part of the value system of the Fair Play settlers.
In matters of faith, there was a certain "live and let live" philosophy,
which had democratic implications. Despite the conflict between Methodists
and Presbyterians, the members of the Presbyterian majority
made their homes available to Methodist preachers.<a name="FNanchor_22_304" id="FNanchor_22_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_304" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This demonstrated
a willingness at least to hear "the other side." Such an atmosphere
is conducive to democracy, if not to conversion. There is
little doubt, however, that this receptivity was due in part to the absence
of any "regular" church or preacher. Here again, the necessities
of the frontier made "democrats" of its occupants.</p>

<p>The most intense patriots are often ethnocentric and chauvinistic.
The Fair Play settlers were such patriots, according to one journalist.<a name="FNanchor_23_305" id="FNanchor_23_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_305" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
However, the patriotism of the eighteenth century had not reached
the level of concern for all mankind which finds expression today.
The pioneers of the West Branch were democrats in an age not yet
conditioned to democracy.</p>

<p>Temperance, particularly with regard to the use of spirited beverages,
usually implies abstinence, which is certainly not democratic
if it is applied in a formally imposed prohibition without any local
option. Abstinence by choice, however, is purely a matter of self-determination.
But in an area where drinking was a commonly accepted
practice, such as the frontier, the term signifies moderation.
In the Fair Play territory drinking, but not drunkenness, was condoned.
The spirit of the frontier, or the use of it, was not incompatible with
democracy.</p>

<p>Frontier values, for the most part then, were democratic in tendency.
Noteworthy for their attitude of community cooperation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
mutual helpfulness, supported by a faith which could not afford to be
exclusive, temperate in their personal habits, particularly in the use
of alcohol, the patriots of the Fair Play territory looked to a future
filled with promise and opportunity for all the diverse elements of their
society. This is the democracy which the frontier nurtured. It flourished
in the West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>In summary then, was self-determination the central theme in the
Fair Play territory? Did the Fair Play settlers truly determine their
own political, economic, and social institutions? The available data
suggest that they did.</p>

<p>The democracy of the Fair Play settlers encompassed popular
sovereignty, political equality, popular consultation, majority rule,
religious freedom, an open class structure, free land, free labor,
and a value system whose dominating feature was mutual helpfulness.
The democracy of Fair Play was basically the fair play of
democracy.</p>

<p>Observable in this atmosphere were the traits of a developing
American character, traits which the frontier historian, Frederick
Jackson Turner, defined as democratic.<a name="FNanchor_24_306" id="FNanchor_24_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_306" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> These included the composite
nationality of a population of mixed national origins; the
self-reliance which the new experience of the frontier developed; the
independence, both of action and in spirit, which the relative isolation
of the environment promoted; a rationalistic, or pragmatic, approach
to problems necessitated by circumstances lacking in precedents for
solution; and perhaps a growing nationalism, marked by an identification
with something larger than the mere Provincial assembly,
something existing, but not yet realized, the American nation.</p>

<p>These traits, in conjunction with Turner's thesis, are a major concern
of the final chapter. That chapter will provide an evaluation of
frontier ethnography as a technique for testing the validity of this
interpretation of Turner's thesis on the Fair Play frontier of the
West Branch Valley.</p>

<h3 class="ity"><big>Frontier Ethnography and the Turner Thesis</big></h3>


<p>In the first chapter of his recent study, <i>The Making of an American
Community</i>, Merle Curti suggests that "less is to be gained
by further analysis of Turner's brilliant and far-ranging but often
ambiguous presentations than by patient and careful study of particular
frontier areas in the light of the investigator's interpretation
of Turner's theory."<a name="FNanchor_1_307" id="FNanchor_1_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_307" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This study was undertaken with just such a
purpose in mind. In addition, it is hoped that this investigation will
give some insight into the value of ethnography and its usefulness as
an analytic technique in studying the frontier.</p>

<p>By definition, ethnography is "the scientific description of nations
or races of men, their customs, habits, and differences."<a name="FNanchor_2_308" id="FNanchor_2_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_308" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Frontier
ethnography is the scientific description of the full institutional pattern
of a particular group of people, located specifically on a certain
frontier, within a certain period of time. That institutional pattern
is described from the analysis of data concerning the political and
economic systems, and the social structure, including religion, the
family, the value system, social classes, art, music, recreation, mythology,
and folklore. Also, as noted in the first two chapters of this
study, geographic and demographic data have been analyzed in an
attempt to picture the area under observation and the people who
inhabited that region. It is believed that these various data present
a fuller view of the "way of life" of these people than the earlier
politico-military accounts of nineteenth-century historians.</p>

<p>Of course, there are certain limitations in this particular analysis.
This study is not meant to be typical of the frontier experience or
necessarily representative of frontier communities. However, it would
have broader implications if a similar study were made for Greene
County in western Pennsylvania, where a group composed mainly of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians also set up a "Fair Play system."<a name="FNanchor_3_309" id="FNanchor_3_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_309" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Furthermore,
it is my interpretation of Turner's thesis which is being tested,
not the validity of the thesis.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Fair Play settlers and their "system" have
been referred to by both Pennsylvania and frontier historians in the
twentieth century, neither the settlers nor their system has been
studied in depth.<a name="FNanchor_4_310" id="FNanchor_4_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_310" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Meginness and Linn, the foremost historians of the
West Branch, were both nineteenth-century writers, and, unfortunately,
twentieth-century scholars have not considered the Fair Play
settlers worthy of their study. Biographical studies are limited to the
work of Edwin MacMinn on Colonel Antes, completed in 1900. As a
result, there has been a definite need for an investigation collating the
researches of these earlier historians and based upon the available
primary data. This study is an attempt to fill the void.</p>

<p>The seeming paucity of primary source materials is a further complication
to the student of Fair Play history. However, letters, journals,
diaries, probate records, tax lists, pension claims, and court records
offer adequate data to the inquiring historian, although the
extra-legal character of the settlement seriously reduced the public
record. Nevertheless, the broad scope of ethnography provides the
kind of study for which the data supply a rather full picture of life
on this frontier. Political, economic, and social patterns are discernible,
although no day-by-day account for any extended period has been
uncovered.</p>

<p>This ethnographic analysis demonstrates the merits of the "civilization
approach" to history. Examining every aspect of a society, it
provides more than a mere "battles and leaders" account. The result
gives insight into a "style of life" rather than a chronology of highlights.
This study has investigated the full institutional structure of
the Fair Play frontier, evaluating that structure in terms of a developing
democracy, or, at least, of democratic tendencies.</p>

<p>American civilization was a frontier civilization from the outset,
and that frontier experience was significant in the development of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
American democracy. Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis,
which has probably inspired more historical scholarship than any other
American thesis, stated that "the existence of an area of free land, its
continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward,
explain American development."<a name="FNanchor_5_311" id="FNanchor_5_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_311" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That development took
place on successive frontiers stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific
Coast over a period of almost three centuries. Turner's second frontier,
the Allegheny Mountains, marked the farmers' frontier of the
Fair Play settlers of the West Branch Valley.</p>

<p>It was on the frontier, according to Turner, that the "true" traits
of American character emerged; its composite nationality, its self-reliant
spirit, its independence of thought and action, its nationalism, and
its rationalistic approach to the problems of a pioneer existence.
The Fair Play settlers, American frontiersmen, suggested some of
these traits in their character. Recognizing the data limitations of
this study, the evidence indicates some validation of this test of Turner's
model. However, it would be presumptuous indeed to conclude
that this analysis offers a complete demonstration of the impact of
the frontier in the development of traits of character which Turner
classified as American.</p>

<p>The composite nationality of the Fair Play settlers is particularly
evident from the demographic analysis offered at the beginning of
this study.<a name="FNanchor_6_312" id="FNanchor_6_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_312" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Seven different national stock groups appeared on this
frontier: Scotch-Irish, English, German, Scots, Irish, Welsh, and
French. Here, indeed, was "the crucible of the frontier," in which
settlers were "Americanized, liberated, and fused into a mixed race."<a name="FNanchor_7_313" id="FNanchor_7_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_313" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The legendary self-reliance of the frontiersman is not without some
basis in fact. The nature of the frontier experience itself was conducive
to its development. Its appearance among the Fair Play settlers
is implied in various contexts. Politically, it is suggested in the creation
of the Fair Play men, the annual governing tribunal, an extra-legal
political agency in this extra-Provincial territory. Economically,
it is intimated in the image of the frontier farmer tackling the wilderness
with rifle and plow and the unbounded determination to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
a better life for himself and his family. Socially, the self-reliance of
these doughty pioneers is indicated in the continuation of their religious
practices and worship, despite the absence of any organized
church. Their self reliance is indicated, as well, in the flexibility of a
social structure whose main criterion was achievement, a society in
which "what" you were was more important than "who" you were.
These examples are, of course, only brief glimpses of the elusive trait
of self-reliance which Turner considered typical of the frontier.</p>

<p>Independence, or the ability to act independently, was a characteristic
frontier trait, according to Turner. The Fair Play settlers presented
some contradictions. It is true that they organized their own
system of government and the code under which it operated. However,
their key leaders lived on the periphery; and the settlers
petitioned the Commonwealth government for assistance in the vital
questions of defense and pre-emption rights.<a name="FNanchor_8_314" id="FNanchor_8_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_314" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Fair Play settlers
were generally independent, a condition promoted by the necessities
of frontier life; but, obviously, they were not isolated.</p>

<p>It is difficult to assess the nationalizing influence of this particular
frontier. In the first place, aside from the Second Continental Congress,
there was no national government during most of the Fair
Play period. The Articles of Confederation were not ratified until
1781, and Fair Play territory was opened to settlement after the
Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784. Furthermore, the patriotism of the
Fair Play settlers seems to reflect an ethnocentric pride in their own
territory and an exaggerated interpretation of its significance to the
developing nation.<a name="FNanchor_9_315" id="FNanchor_9_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_315" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Their patriotism was apparently for an ideal, liberty,
to which they were devoted, having already enjoyed it in a nation
only recently declared, but yet to be recognized. And, for its support,
there had been a rush to the colors by these settlers "beyond
the purchase line."<a name="FNanchor_10_316" id="FNanchor_10_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_316" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The "real American Revolution," as John Adams
described it, was "in the minds and hearts of the people," and it was
"effected before the war Commenced."<a name="FNanchor_11_317" id="FNanchor_11_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_317" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> That revolution had already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
occurred in the Fair Play territory prior to the firing of "the shot
heard round the world" on Lexington green.</p>

<p>The frontier experience had a profound influence on the development
of the American philosophy of pragmatism. Turner claimed
that it was "to the frontier" that "the American intellect owe[d] its
striking characteristics."<a name="FNanchor_12_318" id="FNanchor_12_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_318" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And the Fair Play settlers showed that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness;
that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick
to find expedients; that masterful grasp of material things,
lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that
restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working
for good and for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance
which comes with freedom....<a name="FNanchor_13_319" id="FNanchor_13_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_319" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>The frontiersman of the West Branch was a free spirit in a free
land, a doer rather than a thinker, more concerned with the "hows"
than the "whys" of survival. This practical approach to problems
can be seen in the homes he built, the tools he made, the clothes
he wore, the political and social systems under which he operated, and
the set of values by which he was motivated. The development of
these characteristic American traits owed much to the frontier and
the new experiences which it offered.</p>

<p>This ethnographic analysis of the Fair Play settlers of the West
Branch Valley has attempted to present a clearer picture of the "style
of life" on this particular frontier and, in so doing, to suggest a further
technique for the frontier historian. There are, no doubt, certain
defects in this specific study, but the fault lies with the limitations
of the data rather than the technique. The scope of this investigation
has carried into questions of geography, demography, politics,
economics, social systems, and leadership. Unfortunately, the frontier
had not yet provided the leisure essential to artistic and aesthetic pursuits.
Consequently, these areas were given a limited treatment. Furthermore,
the mythology and folklore of this valley offered little of
record. However, the breadth of this analysis has furnished evidence
of the existence of democracy on this frontier and, thus, support for
Turner's thesis, or at least for this interpretation of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The geographic analysis has clarified the question of the Tiadaghton,
demonstrating that Lycoming Creek, rather than Pine Creek, was the
true eastern boundary of the Fair Play territory. The substantial
destruction of an erroneous legend has been the main contribution
of the geographic part of this study.<a name="FNanchor_14_320" id="FNanchor_14_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_320" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is now clear that the Fair
Play territory extended from Lycoming Creek, on the north side of the
West Branch of the Susquehanna River, to the Great Island, just
east of Lock Haven. This frontier region was beyond the legal limit
of settlement of the Province and the Commonwealth from 1769
to 1784. Hence, within its limits was formed the extra-legal political
system known as Fair Play.</p>

<p>The demographic portion of this study has added to the undermining
of the frontier myth of the Scotch-Irish. The evidence presented
here indicates that it was the frontier, rather than national
origin, which affected the behavior of the pioneers of the West
Branch Valley. The Fair Play settlers, a mixed population of seven
national stock groups, reacted similarly to the common problems of
the frontier experience. In one important exception, the Fair Play
system itself, there is, however, an apparent contradiction. Since no
account of any "fair play system" has turned up in the annals of
the Cumberland Valley, the American reservoir of the Scotch-Irish,
it seems quite probable that the "system" originated in either Northern
Ireland or Scotland, or else on the frontier itself. This probability
offers good ground for further study, particularly when the existence
of a similar "system" in Greene County, which was found in conjunction
with this investigation, is considered.<a name="FNanchor_15_321" id="FNanchor_15_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_321" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If the Fair Play system
originated on the frontier, why did not it also appear on the Virginia
and Carolina frontiers where the Scotch-Irish predominated? Regardless,
the lack of data corroborating the American origin of the Fair
Play system leads to the conclusion that the germ of this political
organization was brought to this country by the Scotch-Irish from
their cultural heritage, and that those elements were found usable
under the frontier conditions of both central and southwestern Pennsylvania.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
If so, the politics of "fair play" will add to, rather than detract
from, the myth of the Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>This study has also brought forward the first complete account of
court records validating the activities of the Fair Play men. Mainly
concerned with the adjudication of land questions, this frontier tribunal
developed an unwritten code which encompassed the problems
of settlement, tenure, and ejectment. Subsequently reviewed in the
regular courts of the counties of which the Fair Play territory became
a part, these cases provide substantial evidence of the existence of a
"system" as well as insight into the manner of its operation. The
fairness of the Fair Play system is marked by the fact that none of the
decisions of its tribunal was later reversed in the established county
courts. Supplemented by the Committee of Safety for Northumberland
County and augmented by peripheral leaders, who gave them a
voice in the higher councils of the State, the Fair Play men and their
government proved adequate to the needs of the settlers, until all
were driven off in the Great Runaway of 1778.</p>

<p>Some corroboration for the legendary tale of a "Fair Play Declaration
of Independence" was found in the course of this study. Although
consisting, in the main, of accounts culled from the records of
Revolutionary War pension claimants made some eighty years after
the event, the evidence is that of a contemporary.<a name="FNanchor_16_322" id="FNanchor_16_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_322" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> However, the
most common objection to this conclusion, that the Fair Play declaration
was merely the reading of a copy of Jefferson's Declaration,
is unsubstantiated by the archival descriptions.<a name="FNanchor_17_323" id="FNanchor_17_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_323" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Perhaps the Fair
Play declaration is apocryphal, but, lacking valid disclaimers, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Hamilton data offer some basis for a judgment. It is the tentative
conclusion of this writer that there was such a declaration on the
banks of Pine Creek in July of 1776.</p>

<p>The Fair Play territory was truly "an area of free land" in which
a "new order of Americanism" emerged.<a name="FNanchor_18_324" id="FNanchor_18_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_324" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Individualistic and self-reliant
of necessity, the pioneers of this farmers' frontier rationally
developed their solution to the problem of survival in the wilderness,
a democratic squatter sovereignty. With land readily available
and a free labor system to work it, provided that the family was
large enough to assure sufficient "hands," these agrarian frontiersmen
not only cultivated the soil but also a free society. And their cooperative
spirit, despite their mixed national origins, was markedly
noticeable at harvesttime. From such spirit are communities formed,
and from such communities a democratic society emerges.</p>

<p>This analysis has not only described the geography and demography,
the politics and economics of the Fair Play settlers; it has also examined
the basis and structure of this society, including the value
system which undergirded it. The results have pictured the religious
liberty extant in a frontier society isolated from any regular or established
church, a liberty of conscience which left each man free to
worship according to the dictates of his own faith. This freedom,
this right to choose for himself, made the Fair Play settler surprisingly
receptive to other groups and their practices, practices which he was
free to reject, and often did.<a name="FNanchor_19_325" id="FNanchor_19_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_325" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This analysis has also pointed up the
class structure and its significance in promoting order in a frontier
community. And finally, an examination of the value system of these
Pennsylvania pioneers has provided an understanding of why they
behaved as they did.</p>

<p>The last major aspect of this investigation concerned the nature of
leadership. Determined by the people, and thus essentially democratic,
it had certain peculiar characteristics. In the first place, the
top leaders tended to come from the Fair Play community in its
broadest social sense, but not from the Fair Play territory in its narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
geographic sense.<a name="FNanchor_20_326" id="FNanchor_20_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_326" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Secondly, the political participation of the
Fair Play settlers, if office-holding is any criterion, emphasizes the
high degree of involvement in terms of the total population.<a name="FNanchor_21_327" id="FNanchor_21_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_327" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> And
last, this leadership appeared to be overextended when faced with the
problem of defending its own frontier and the new nation which was
striving so desperately for independence. Consequently, it was forced
to turn to established government for support. This may have been
the embryonic beginning of the nationalism which the frontier fostered
in later generations.</p>

<p>What then, is the meaning of this particular study, an ethnographic
interpretation of Turner's thesis? Turner himself, gave the best argument
for ethnography. He said that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... the economist, the political scientist, the psychologist,
the sociologist, the geographer, the student of literature,
of art, of religion&mdash;all the allied laborers in the study of society&mdash;have
contributions to make to the equipment of the
historian. These contributions are partly of material, partly
of tools, partly of new points of view, new hypotheses, new
suggestions of relations, causes, and emphasis. Each of these
special students is in some danger of bias by his particular
point of view, by his exposure to see simply the thing in which
he is primarily interested, and also by his effort to deduce the
universal laws of his separate science. The historian, on the
other hand, is exposed to the danger of dealing with the complex
and interacting social forces of a period or of a country
from some single point of view to which his special training
or interest inclines him. If the truth is to be made
known, the historian must so far familiarize himself with the
work, and equip himself with the training of his sister-subjects
that he can at least avail himself of their results
and in some reasonable degree master the essential tools of
their trade.<a name="FNanchor_22_328" id="FNanchor_22_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_328" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>Frontier ethnography is just such an effort.</p>

<p>The frontier ethnographer then, because of his interdisciplinary approach,
can capture the spirit of pioneer life. And if, as Turner suggested,
the frontier explains American development, then frontier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
ethnography presents an understanding of the American ethos with
its ideals of discovery, democracy, and individualism.<a name="FNanchor_23_329" id="FNanchor_23_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_329" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> These ideals
characterize "the American spirit and the meaning of America in
world history."<a name="FNanchor_24_330" id="FNanchor_24_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_330" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The ideal of discovery, "the courageous determination to break new
paths," as Turner called it, was abundantly evident in the Fair Play
territory of the West Branch Valley.<a name="FNanchor_25_331" id="FNanchor_25_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_331" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This innovating spirit can be
seen in the piercing of the Provincial boundary, despite the restrictive
legislation to the contrary, and the establishment of homes in Indian
territory.<a name="FNanchor_26_332" id="FNanchor_26_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_332" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was also demonstrated in a marvelous adaptability in
solving the new problems of the frontier, problems for which the old
dogmas were no longer applicable. The new world of the Susquehanna
frontier made new men, Americans.</p>

<p>Self-determination, the ideal of democracy as we have defined it,
was the cornerstone of Fair Play society. Its particular contribution
was the Fair Play "system" with its popularly elected tribunal of Fair
Play men. Perhaps this was the proper antecedent of the commission
form of local government which came into vogue on the progressive
wave of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Regardless, the geographic limitations of the Fair Play territory, the
frequency of elections, and the open conduct of meetings tend to
substantiate the democratic evaluation which has been made of the
politics of this frontier community. Furthermore, as was pointed out
in the last chapter, this self-determination was the key characteristic
of the economic and social life of these people.<a name="FNanchor_27_333" id="FNanchor_27_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_333" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The pioneer ideal of creative and competitive individualism, which
Turner considered America's best contribution to history and to
progress, was an essential of the frontier experience which became an
integral part of the American mythology.<a name="FNanchor_28_334" id="FNanchor_28_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_334" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The "myth of the happy
yeoman," as one historian called it, is still revered in American folklore
and respected in American politics, whether it is outmoded or
not.<a name="FNanchor_29_335" id="FNanchor_29_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_335" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The primitive nature of frontier life developed this characteristically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
American trait and the family, the basic organization of social
control, promoted it. It was this promotion, with its antipathy to any
outside control, which stimulated the Revolution, creating an American
nation from an already existing American character.</p>

<p>The individualism of the West Branch frontier is also apparent in
the administration of justice. The Fair Play system emphasized the
personality of law, by its very title, rather than the organized machinery
of justice.<a name="FNanchor_30_336" id="FNanchor_30_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_336" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Frontier law was personal and direct, resulting in
the unchecked development of the individual, a circumstance which
Turner considered the significant product of this frontier democracy.<a name="FNanchor_31_337" id="FNanchor_31_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_337" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Being personal, though, it had meaning for those affected by it, as
an anecdote noted earlier indicated.<a name="FNanchor_32_338" id="FNanchor_32_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_338" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Individualism has become somewhat of an anachronism in a mass
society, but its obsolescence today is part of the current American
tragedy. The buoyant self-confidence which it inspired has made much
of the American dream a reality. Legislation, it is true, has taken the
place of free lands as the means of preserving democracy, but it will
be a hollow triumph if that legislation suppresses this essential trait
of the American character, its individualism. No intelligent person
today would recommend a return to the laissez-faire individualism
of the Social Darwinists of the late nineteenth century, but it must be
admitted that a society emphasizing the worth of the individual and
dedicated to principles of justice and fair play, the banner under
which the frontiersmen of the West Branch operated, has genuine
merit.</p>

<p>Whether the historian is analyzing old frontiers or charting new
ones, the timeless question remains: does man have the intelligence
adequate to secure his own survival? The old frontiers, such as the
Fair Play territory of the West Branch of the Susquehanna, were
free lands of opportunity for a better life, and the history of the
westward movement of the American people gives ample proof of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
their conquest. But the new frontiers are not so clearly marked or
so easily conquered. Perhaps a re-examination of the history of the
old frontiers can give increased meaning to the problems of the new.
This investigation was attempted, in part, to serve such a purpose.</p>

<p>The intelligent solution to the problem of survival for the pioneers
of the West Branch Valley was fair play. The ethnography of the
Fair Play settlers is the record of the democratic development of an
American community under the impact of the new experience of the
frontier.</p>
